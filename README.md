Open dataset for sentiment analysis based on ICO IEO ITO reviews in english

Most of the open data sets for text classification that refer to ICO ITO IEO project reviews are scarce. This is a small data set that can be used as a starting point, plus the reviews are in English. Therefore, we want the dataset to be available to everyone for sentiment analysis.

We provide a file with the reviews
* reviews.csv - 6000 lines
