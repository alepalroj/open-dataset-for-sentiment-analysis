tokengoplatform.com,the project bribed me with just one approach to the bounty of the company the efforts of the authors to the face are so thought out so much! everyone would be so creative in their projects! i think that the project will shoot with such an approach otherwise nothing!,1
tokengoplatform.com,e people have already put a lot of effort and labor into the project which means that they have very serious intentions ,1
gamestars.io,the goal is achieved ,1
gamestars.io, they are not interested in anything ,0
gamestars.io, the investor's obscene attitude to investors does not solve the problems; there are facts of theft of tokens from investors by the creators of the token from the investor’s personal account ,0
gamestars.io, exchanges for the sale of tokens were selected by thieves yobit swindlers who opened an invest and dice where the tokens were taken for an invest from and dice is a question ,0
gamestars.io, the token exchange rate from $ 0.035 dropped by 30% in two days and will continue to fall as there is no demand for this token there is no trust in this token traders do not have trust in the team as all they do is information that is closed to investors,0

latoken.com,a worthy exchange from our compatriots ,1
latoken.com, a friend worked there for a long time because i know from the inside it is quite profitable for the owners because they do not plan to close ,1

blocklancer.net,hello! my personal opinion is that these guys are worth taking a closer look at gave blocklancer the ico of the day here is their positive conclusion,1
blocklancer.net, which reflects my opinion: according to blocklancer's business model token holders will earn on commissions that the project takes for transactions and additional paid services such as vacancy allocation ,1
blocklancer.net, the creators prepared a separate business plan in which they described in detail how they will make money ,1
blocklancer.net, this is good news ,1
blocklancer.net, the distribution of funds according to the whitepaper is quite standard 78% of tokens have a public turnover 20% goes to the team ,1
blocklancer.net, of all the recruiting projects i've seen blocklancer is the clear favorite ,1

zynecoin.io, the rest of their team looks prepared to develop this project ,1
www.zooomex.com,zooomex is an interesting kind of exchange ,1
www.zooomex.com,because their team has only 3 members wtf ,0
www.zooomex.com, the fact that they have a working mvp is the living proof that they have an external company that builds their exchange ,1
www.zooomex.com, i've seen such projects they gather funds and business plan and they pay other people to implement it ,0
www.zooomex.com, it's good but they should mention it somewhere ,1

www.zeux.tech, experience of team members seems to be abundant and the field to be used with mr jose is also skillful in stabilizing this industry ,1
mnode.chainfund.ch,zero fee close ended tokenized masternode fund that provides investors with diversified exposure to passive coin income ,1
mnode.chainfund.ch, a masternode provides key services to a blockchain for which it receives block rewards however masternodes are often inaccessible to the average retail investor as they require large initial capital investments and technical knowledge ,1
mnode.chainfund.ch, the masternode fund is a new type of investment vehicle,1
mnode.chainfund.ch, by purchasing the masternode fund token really ?,0

zaza-world.io,zaza's concept of a b2b marketplace is a interesting idea ,1
zaza-world.io, the team look competent although more sales and marketing focused than tech focused ,0
zaza-world.io, they have a nice looking mvp platform that you can test online ,1
zaza-world.io, however i have concerns about just how much a unique and discreet blockchain is required in this project existing platforms could be used for the trust and reputation and even international transactions component an additional concern would be adoption ,0
zaza-world.io, why would companies add an additional bottleneck rather than utilise existing b2b and b2c platforms and market places? overall a decent project that is a little too centralised in nature and needs to think more deeply about why they need a unique token for reasons beyond the initial fund raise ,0
zaza-world.io,zaza consists of a strong team ,1
zaza-world.io, idea is old but there is definitely a place in the market for this idea ,1
zaza-world.io, they need to spend enough money in marketing to make this project success ,0
zaza-world.io, b2b in social media will bring plenty of benefits a proper mvp would have been nice to have ,0
zaza-world.io, good luck team ,1
zaza-world.io,zaza consists of a strong team ,1
zaza-world.io, though the idea isn’t fresh there is definitely a place in the market for this idea ,0
zaza-world.io, they will require a lot of efforts in their advertising and marketing to make this project a success ,0

peculium.io,your mew can store pcl did i understand the question correctly?,0
medibloc.org,your information is not completely accurate about who owns and controls medical 
medibloc.org, physicians are the gateway of control over protection and ownership of medical records see legal cases ,0
medibloc.org, though this is moving towards user centered models currently patients are not in control of records healthcare ico's that focus on medical records transference have to address this both in real world and in future setting ,0
medibloc.org, it would be amazing to state that patients own currently their records as i believe they are entitled to but legally the red tape makes this not so focusing on the unique relationship between providers and patients and addressing solutions for removing the resistance points between them should be the focus of healthcare ico's ,0
medibloc.org, this is not a negative review but i think their needssw to be better understanding of medical legal implications from the team ,1
medibloc.org, i am a huge supporter of healthcare ico's ,1
test.ton.org,your going wiith the capital lol,0

www.bitdegree.org,you're so misinformed it's scary ,0
www.bitdegree.org, who the hell has been brainwashing you or are you just a paid shill yourself? ,0
www.bitdegree.org, there's plenty of articles on the bitdegree blog explaining why this decision was made ,1
www.bitdegree.org, students get discounts using bdg teachers earn 99% if students pay with bdg ,1
www.bitdegree.org, why would the team continue to write articles make videos chat on telegram show photos of themselves and their location?? most icos dont even have a working fucking product and you're saying this project is going to fail ,0
www.bitdegree.org, while most projects are sitting behind their whitepaper promises this one is showing me results and if you're an investor why the fuck didnt you sell your tokens when they were 10x in price? cause by spreading fud you're ruining it for the rest of us ,1
wanchain.org,you're safe man! hehe ,0
view.ly,you're being ridiculous ,0
view.ly, do you realize almost every ico has complaints filed against them for one thing or the other? this isn't anything unusual in the ico space any time someone has something go a different way than they want they go crying to the government to save them yet when the government protects them they complain ,0
view.ly, such hypocrites keep the government out of this space ,0
spectivvr.com,you'll get the tokens after ico ends ,1
cryptics.tech,you write that the accuracy of the eth prediction is 82% the only question that exists is whether it is so or not the only thing you need to do is post your forecast every day and then 24h later post the real price of the eth and you need to do this for a long time for many weeks and so that it was reliably known what you were predicting and what real price was in 24 hours ,0
retainly.co,you would be glad to know that we are the first loyalty rewards company to go live with our dapp ,1

www.hybridblock.io,you were right like most project it was just a money grab ,0
www.hybridblock.io, wonder if investors will take legal action !!,1
catholiccoins.org, you were spamming the group,0
transcodium.com,you want to convert a file you make a request to our master node it splits them encrypts and sends to the miners to process them the money paid will be shared amongst the miners who converted your file more in whitepaper,1
ankr.network,you sure? dont think so ,0
blockstack.org,you should also pay attention to who actually invested in this platform ,1
blockstack.org, most ico's have no app and are only concepts and probably no future ,0
fintechbit.io,you select the package that fits your needs ,1
blocklancer.net,you receive the bounty token after the ico ,1
belotto.io,you promise transparency and honesty that's fine ,1
belotto.io, but that's why your topic about the bounty project is already sent to the ban for the second time the report on the company in the table is not filled and the administrator in the telegraph does not answer ,0
plaza.systems,you project is very interesting !,1
paytailor.com,you need to invite several international experts in your project and do something to make the idea more original ,0

bithemoth.com,you need to focus on one thing to be good at it ,0
bithemoth.com, if you try to do a lot of things in parellel you will most likely fail ,0
bithemoth.com, the team looks very young ,0

bithemoth.com, to provide a permanent solution to the blockchain world is our goal ,1
bithemoth.com, one of the greatest asset platforms ,1
bithemoth.com, i couldn’t find in the proposal any attribute that justify the use of blockchain in the project as decentralization democratization… or at least some added value points for reducing the barriers to entering cryptology in such a platform ,0 
bithemoth.com, i´d like to have seen a mvp running may be the exchange in alpha version ,0
bithemoth.com, i´m not very confident that they will reach the goals despite 13 people working in the project not too much experience in the crypto space i presume ,0
www.unboxed.network,for every brand related photo you upload and for every comment you post you get paid,1
www.unboxed.network, sounds great in theory there seems to be an experienced team let's see how you make it work ,1
buff.game,· the team is excellent ,1
buff.game, · the project understands the block chain and each other is effective ,1
buff.game, · is the 255 million tokens released to the market appropriate for the expected market size? · milestones are set roughly ,0
buff.game, i hope to be segmented ,0
buff.game, · although it is written in the white paper that ico is started from q3 in 2018 it has not been announced at the present time ,0
buff.game, · the team is not doing kyc if the team does this i will probably upgrade the rating to 5 ,0

www.otppay.io, really? pretty cocky claim ,0
www.otppay.io, i don't see the point of having a 'bridge' between crypto and fiat? is that not what bitcoin does? lending ,0
www.otppay.io, what are your interest rates going to be? will this be another payday loan project with short term lending to the poor in india with high rates? you don't tell us in the whitepaper ,0
www.otppay.io, merchants lending? sounds like a disaster in the making 19 million for the public and employees from the billion being allocated? that's less than two percent while 200 million is reserved for tech and operational for otppay management? you want to do buybacks and burn from a capped cryptocurrency to pump the price? while that's interesting in theory you will eventually burn through the cryptocurrency mathematically ,0
www.otppay.io, you don't show any math to prove your thesis that this will work ,0
www.otppay.io, in fact there's no math or algorithms in the whitepaper at all ,0
www.otppay.io, it's a very pretty deck with stunning graphics but it's not a whitepaper ,0
www.otppay.io, visa and mastercard have put a clamp on all cryptocurrency debit cards with the death of wavecrest ,0

onlinegamecoin.com, most of team linked in or other social media profiles missing ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, concept has nothing to solve blockchain related problems ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, it's just an yet another token on ethereum blockchain without adding much value ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, no blockchain expertise in team ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, no technical details in white paper and no other form of information available like one pager or pitch deck etc ,0
ewaiter.io, weak legal part they use prohibited words in white paper like invest benefit and other that's automatically makes token security hidden buyback security token ,0
ewaiter.io, i like the idea but i think this is exaggeration of real problem ,1
ewaiter.io, no details on whitepaper ,0
ewaiter.io, they don't need new token ,0
ewaiter.io, on white paper hard cap is 8m on the site 400k,0
www.nedviga.realty, the team lacks a lot of key employees ,0
www.nedviga.realty, this is not about blockchain this is about real business ,0
www.nedviga.realty, reading the wp is developing a lasting impression give us money to develop our business ,0
www.nedviga.realty, no specifics of what and how it will work,0
www.gilgameshplatform.com, the team is very small and not known in this space ,0
www.gilgameshplatform.com, vision is very good ,0
www.gilgameshplatform.com, as a product of its own not so sure about it please redo financials and whitepaper as well its paint to read it,0
www.urallowance.com, the team has the different experiences required to make it a success provided sufficient funding is raised and additional resources are added when comercial release is ready to go ,1
www.urallowance.com, even good ideas and good products could never see growth due to insufficient funding raised this last is partly also market dependent ,0
www.urallowance.com, i personally like the vision of the ura use case although i also see other variants which i'm sure the team will find more use cases as they go along ,1
www.urallowance.com, here it is not so much if the ura product requires blockchain or not actually i believe blockchain is an inherent part of the vision of this company to educate the new generation about crypto and blockchain in a soft and smooth non technical manner by encuraging young and old actually using its product the potential is there the rest is up to execution ,1
www.urallowance.com, looked at the mvp link and for a proto type it´s great its just that personally i am a fierce believer of the bigger ticket fundraising amounts to go in when comercial product is ready so in short i love it but i suggest a secondary bigger raise to fund growth when commercial product is tested and released ,1
www.urallowance.com, overall i like the ura project!!! this is not any advice or recommendation to invest in ura but rather to encourage you to do your own personal due diligence and decide for yourself ,1
www.urallowance.com, if you do decide to buy ura tokens or any other ones then be sensible and don't spend more then you are willing to loose completely new projects up to the early growth phase included are the riskiest of all but then again those very low single digit percentage who in the end do succeed could potentially be a great opportunity so good luck in whatever you decide as the only responsible for your decisions is yourself ,1
aco.ai, the platform is not ready yet ,0
aco.ai, white paper clams that service will provide free and open to any legal project in any country which is deceiving in my opinion as every country has absolutely different laws regarding crowdfunding and investments ,0
aco.ai, it's simply impossible to make it work in every country in my opinion the ceo is not experienced enough for large scale international project like this ,0
aco.ai, founder has linkedin profile with only 2 job places: resident of the hospital from 2014 and acorn collective since june 2017 quote from ceo profile: having launched web businesses and run successful digital marketing campaigns for a decade moritz believes technology brings business within reach of everyone everywhere it's unclear what businesses he has previously run ,0
aco.ai, the rest of the team and advisory board look solid ,1
aco.ai, product is not unique provided service is moderately competitive ,0
aco.ai, the service could be easily replicated by competitors at the same time platform tries to solve serious market problems and has its demand in compare with similar projects acorn collective token economics is not so attractive: it has significant bonus disproportion between late and early token buyers ,0
aco.ai, weak marketing video,0
trakinvest.ai, the management team has strong expertise and is backed by experienced advisers ,1
trakinvest.ai, the market that is being addressed is quite competitive and the offerings provided by trakinvest already exist ,0
trakinvest.ai, execution of the vision is the key to success and in a market where there are other challengers the management team may provide the edge ,1
www.coinxes.io, team is great and responsible ,1
www.coinxes.io, vision is really interested because a lot of projects will be secure those who are willing to come on platform and it will avoid scam and get potential traffic to promote real peojects ,1
www.coinxes.io, product is nice but i will be looking for complete functional product,1
www.airsavetravel.com, team : team seems unbalanced but there are some experienced people in the team ,1
www.airsavetravel.com, vision : this project growth and the individual profits only relay on referrals,1
www.airsavetravel.com, product : there is an existing mobile app which is something most projects don't have before their ico/ieo ,1
faceter.io, strong team with relevant experience ,1
faceter.io, demanded product with a large market potential ,1
faceter.io, unique product ,1
faceter.io, attractive token model ,1
faceter.io, solid business model with great long term strategy ,1

dbrain.io, strong team ,1
dbrain.io, i love the product and vision ,1
dbrain.io, big data ai and machine learning are definitely great use cases for blockchain ,1
dbrain.io, already has an alpha product ,1
dbrain.io, this project definitely has potential to be something greate ,1
dbrain.io, ico price may be too expensive given current market conditions which may deter many investors ,0
dbrain.io, not smart to have a high price per coin during a crypto bear market metric should be revised to have a successful ico,0
solana.com, solana's team brings together engineers with years of experience in the field of engineering has made qualcomm intel and other well known technology companies obviously with such an experienced background we have hope for the development team to know what they want to do and what to do to create the product as desired ,1
solana.com, solana's github has updated the source code and has full instructions on how to run the testnet the single node and the multinode ,1
solana.com, track the current roadmap solana is still sticking to the plan set out ,1
solana.com, if solana keeps up with the current progress the moment they start selling tokens q1 2019 is when they have a complete blockchain platform in hand this is a huge plus ,1
threatintelligence.market, small team ,0
threatintelligence.market, unclear white paper ,0
threatintelligence.market, not working links to all legal documents on web site,0
socialgood-foundation.com, ridiculous hardcap of $500 million in this bear market it's an unbelievable dream ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, it's basically a token used for payment and cash back i don't see why $500 million is needed ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, i do not see any reason why the price should increase? it's a chicken and egg problem without any users mass adoption it's not going to succeed and i certainly dont see why it will succeed ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, the team predict the price increment based purely on supply and demand is naive ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, it doesn't work this simple ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, the fine is not bad ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, initial token price of $50 and end price of $100? it's a bonus of 100% which is destined for a dump when listed on exchange verdict: no go ,0
www.originprotocol.com, really strong team with more experiences ,1
www.originprotocol.com, decentalized marketplace is good for future ,1
www.originprotocol.com, see on github i see they working hard for mvp ,1

solarex.io, pros ✅ vision ✅ good team ,1
solarex.io, cons ⛔️ no blockchain need ⛔️ mvp should not be a video ⛔️ very high hard cap even if this project has good intentions i really don't see a future for it there's not a product ready at the moment and it lacks of many important information ,0

www.rightmesh.io, pre sale closed in 8 minutes and raised $18m with 20% bonus ,1
www.rightmesh.io, claim to have 100+ people working on rightmesh ,1
www.rightmesh.io, why selling only 30% of tokens? and at $100m valuation? they seem to be working on this problem since 2015 but released whitepaper in 2017 ,0
www.rightmesh.io, cto already raised $300k for a failed startup before called redtree robotics ,0
www.rightmesh.io, i don't like the fact that they sell themselves as trying to help poor people they're not a non profit but that's my personal opinion,0
www.archicoin.io, only 2 developers for a technically complex project ,0
www.archicoin.io, vision is ok but they have a great competitors like storj ,0

iungo.network, inflated vision claims and no clear timing on end result ,0
iungo.network, joining of an advisor should be a minor thing in terms of project development but is listed in roadmap ,1
iungo.network, twitter account looks non organic ,0
iungo.network, very generic explainer video without a clear message: large part discusses current situation and it's challenges rather than explaining the solution ,0

www.xcrypt.club,xcrypt is yet another project which is trying to set up a crypto exchange ,0
www.xcrypt.club, it proposes to develop an exchange where investors can trade utility tokens security tokens and non fungible tokens ,1
www.xcrypt.club, based on the review of the team credentials in the whitepaper and social media it appears that they do not have any significant experience in running a crypto exchange business some of the team members seem to be working on the project only on part time basis as can be evidenced from multiple positions held on linkedin profile ,0
www.xcrypt.club, other interesting thing is that the number of advisors listed exceed the total number of team members ,0
www.xcrypt.club, not sure how much value is added by having so many advisors and what value add each individual advisor is providing to the project ,0
www.xcrypt.club, the use of blockchain technology to seems to be at the core of the business but don’t see them adding a lot of value to already crowded crypto exchange space ,0
www.xcrypt.club, it appears that the project is currently at mvp stage ,1
www.xcrypt.club, however there is no access provided to a demo of the platform ,0
www.xcrypt.club, overall the concept of the project is nothing new to the crypto industry ,0
www.xcrypt.club, crypto exchange space is already very crowded with number of exchanges far exceeding the number of projects existing exchanges themselves are finding it very difficult to stay afloat so starting a new exchange from scratch and building a sizable user base is a herculean task ,0
www.xcrypt.club, i would not invest in an exchange which is still at conceptual stage and doesn’t have any user base or regulatory license ,0
www.xcrypt.club, crypto exchange business is a natural monopoly which benefits from the economies of scale and network effects in the long term only a handful of players would be able to survive ,0

www.xcoynz.com,xcoynz is yet another project which is trying to set up a crypto exchange ,0
www.xcoynz.com, based on the review of the team credentials in the whitepaper and social media it appears that they do not have any significant experience in running a crypto exchange business ,0
www.xcoynz.com, most of the team members except the founder seem to be working on the project only on part time basis as can be evidenced from multiple positions held on linkedin profile ,0
www.xcoynz.com, as per linkedin one of the team members tushar gaikwad has left the project in october 2018 however he continues to be featured as team member ,0
www.xcoynz.com, other interesting thing is that the number of advisors listed exceed the total number of team members ,0
www.xcoynz.com, not sure how much value is added by having so many advisors and what value add each individual advisor is providing to the project ,0
www.xcoynz.com, the use of blockchain technology to seems to be at the core of the business but don’t see them adding a lot of value to already crowded crypto exchange space ,0
www.xcoynz.com, it appears that the project is currently at conceptual stage ,1
www.xcoynz.com, overall the team looks inadequate with most team members working part time this shows lack of complete commitment from the core team to the project which is a huge concern for me ,0
www.xcoynz.com, concept of the project is nothing new to the crypto industry ,0
www.xcoynz.com, crypto exchange space is already very crowded with number of exchanges far exceeding the number of projects ,0

intuitioncoin.org, the discord has a russian hackers ,0
intuitioncoin.org, 2 heading and the devs you can't read who is who ,0
intuitioncoin.org, so who can you trust intuition meaning a thing that one knows or considers likely from instinctive feeling rather than conscious reasoning ,0

www.silkchain.io, this is the pitch for marketing and sale hope the team will improve this ,0
dragonglass.com,with so many gaming projects infiltrating the blockchain we have to ask the question does blockchain need gaming or does gaming need the blockchain? it appears to be more of the latter ,0

bablos.com,with all respect to the original work of victor pelevin and work the film team could probably completed this project should not even introduce itself as an ico ,0
bablos.com, there is no platform available for use and no clear understanding for what funds are collected whether for film or a film crowdinvesting platform ,0
bablos.com, even if this project is not a scam it already provide a demonstration that team was unable to collect funds for film properly or investors considered as potentially unsuccesfull ,0
bablos.com, the project has no legal structure at all and token model is highly probable to be considered as a form of security ,0
bablos.com, the team is unable to make difference between crowdinvesting crowdfunding and ico ,0
crypt-on.io,with all my respect the team should be reinforced to reach the project`s targets ,0
crypt-on.io, a few consultants as advisors is not enough to create globally the platform with secure transactions and escrow service ,0
crypt-on.io, the whitepaper contains a long description of the product with no numbers ,0
crypt-on.io, competitive analysis and business planning approach should be added here for sure as it a highly competitive area or it is not accepted as a paper related to investments/fundraising ,0

coss.io,with a new solid platform i see no reason why coss exchange shouldn’t go to 50m/day trading volume ,0
coss.io, although today’s activity is very low they still have a huge following ,1
coss.io, many coss token holders are monitoring the evolution of coss but they prefer to trade elsewhere due to the current state of the platform ,0
coss.io, these traders will be fairly easy to bring back once positive news start to hit the market ,1
xriba.com,with a great vision and that is the utmost need of the hour especially when the whole crypto market is facing scam projects surviving on the money collected from investors ,1
xriba.com, the concept is also in line with daico concept from ethereum founder wherein the accountability of funds use will be in the hands of investors another similar project that reminds me is ledgerium which is otherwise building a similar product for accounting records on the blockchain ,1
databrokerdao.com,wish there were more devs on the teams for such an ambitious project ,0
databrokerdao.com, great vision but all comes down to execution ,0
databrokerdao.com, i do not like the minime token model and could not find any info on the project roadmap in the whitepaper or on icobench this has me skeptical ,0
databrokerdao.com, one thing i noticed is that you have patrick byrne ceo of overstock com ceo of tzero exchange and polymath partner listed as an advisor in the whitepaper but no mention of him on icobench how involved is he with the project? do you also have plans to work with polymath? if all the answer is yes and patrick byrne has a decent amount of involvement this could really be a winner otherwise im skeptic ,0

solarex.io, 65 mln usd hard cap? does the team understand the current state of ico market and can it be successful? no competitive analysis with other possible solutions no business planning in numbers the wp should be improved ,0

daox.org,whitepaper is well written team appears competent ,0
daox.org, why is the soft cap showing in usd but the hard cap is showing in dxc??? ,0
daox.org, it makes it appear that they are trying to mask the fact that they are trying to raise $60 million ,0
daox.org, the question becomes why do you need $60 million and how do you plan to allocate it? the whitepaper does not provide a breakdown of this 
daox.org, will update product rating when there is an mvp or prototype ,0
www.tokenaire.club,whitepaper is too light ,0
www.tokenaire.club, needs pie charts for token allocation and use of proceeds also more detail ,0
www.tokenaire.club, 16 pages of large fonts and graphic heavy is not enough ,0
www.tokenaire.club, thought the raise is modest enough at less than a million euro on the hard cap 168 btc ,1
www.tokenaire.club, ceo has strong software engineering background but not a lot of experience running companies but i would rather have a guy who can cut code with less ceo skills than a guy who can't cut code and has run old school companies for a career ,0
www.tokenaire.club, all in all they should be able to make their raise ,1
www.tokenaire.club, the idea is good ,1
www.tokenaire.club, kind of fun among friends and not just for the elite ,0
www.xrtfoundation.org,whitepaper is pretty weak ,0
www.xrtfoundation.org, doesn't seem like there is a real need for blockchain in this project ,0
www.xrtfoundation.org, team looks very young/not as experienced ,0
www.xrtfoundation.org, however good strong team of advisors ,1
www.xrtfoundation.org, highly recommend the advisors to aid the team in this project in terms of whitepaper/token use cases ,0
www.noizchain.com,whitepaper is just a marketing whitepaper and does not include much infos how they do things ,0
www.noizchain.com, tokeneconomies is centralized and flawed in my opinion as the advertisers sends money to noiz and noiz is doing the exchange ,0
www.noizchain.com, where are they taken the liquidity from? tokenallocation the project gives only away 45% in tokensale and the founding team keeps 20% ,0
www.noizchain.com, that's a very high stake team is experienced in the advertising industry but i do not see too much of expertise in the crypto space,0
www.bcnex.net,whitepaper is failed to upload no technical team and advisor or ambassador i don't have much confidence in the team the project at this stage is not much more than a whitepaper and i don't see much emphasis on building a product ,0
fabrictoken.io,whitepaper and website were translated to russian but when will they be uploaded?,0
squeezer.io,whitepaper a bit thin big fonts and graphics and 21 pages needs more thinking math and text ,0

squeezer.io, team is strong ,1
www.whiterabbit.one,white rabbit is an ambitious project looking to solve all the problems involving the streaming of media content ,1
www.whiterabbit.one, the team is pretty awesome ,1
www.whiterabbit.one, not only is the team very big but each individual also has a very specific and relevant background needed for the white rabbit project to succeed ,1
www.whiterabbit.one, they're looking to solve the problems using a combination of methods such as an universal browser plugin a streaming portal and approved partner streaming sites all using blockchain technology think of using smart contracts to send the content right holders their share of the profit ,1
www.whiterabbit.one, altought the methods have been thought of i do believe that there is not enough encouragement for individuals to download and use the white rabbit browser plugin ,0
www.whiterabbit.one, additionally it is unclear to me whether enough content right holders will co operate with the project to gain enough traction and give the project the boost it needs ,0
centcoin.money,no white paper ,0
centcoin.money, screenshots of trading from the exchange funny token created on wavesplatform there are more than 5.000 tokens of this kind and they are created in the constructor in 15 minutes! in the team ,0
centcoin.money, the ceo judging by the last name is ukrainian who has nothing to do with the development and work in such projects! and also a wallet with which the admin will pump the price of his token ,0
centcoin.money, at the same time there is no actual demand for the token and there are no accounts involved in trading except for the admin account ! it turns out that the project is definitely a scam and the admin is a crook! ,0
centcoin.money,in general nothing is definitely past white paper is no screenshots of trade from the exchange is funny a token created on wavesplatform ,0
centcoin.money, there are more than 5000 tokens of this kind and they are created in the constructor in 15 minutes! in the ceo team judging by the name there is a ukrainian who has nothing to do with the development and work in such projects! and another wallet with which the admin pump the price of his token ,0
centcoin.money, it turns out the project is uniquely scam and the admin is a crook! in general about anything ,0
twilight-coin.io,white paper is written well with details being mapped out ,1
twilight-coin.io, team is strong with relevant background experience to execute this project ,1
twilight-coin.io, perhaps the team may consider appointing advisors to guide the project through the ico phase ,0
cryptoindex.io,white paper is not available access denied ,0
kyc.legal,white paper did not mention anything about the risk of identity theft and how to secure it on the agents' side there is no guarantee that the certified agents might be might sell your id info on the dark web for a much higher price than the reward ,0
momsavenue.com,white paper claims to reach 1000 active users in 2017 how to reach this number in two weeks time without an mvp as of today 9 dec 2017?,0
hostingicos.io, the whitepaper is quite messy without a clear definition of token usage ,0
hostingicos.io, the detailed breakdown in tokenomics is quite strange and it lacks necessary information to make informed decisions ,0
hostingicos.io, the core team and the advisory team members are inexperienced to pull a project of this magnitude through ,0
hostingicos.io, basically 4 core team members and 2 advisors raising money with a non existent business plan ,0
hostingicos.io, the information on team members is lacking and so doesn’t invoke any confidence ,0
hostingicos.io, the tokenomics is one of the most strangest i have ever seen ,0
hostingicos.io, during token distribution 12% is reserved for the team and after tge the founders/ team take 15% out of the total proceeds one of the most illogical and greediest distributions ever ,0
hostingicos.io, it shows the founders themselves have no confidence in their product ,0
hostingicos.io, clarifications?? business model ,0
hostingicos.io, the business model is very unclear ,0
hostingicos.io, also effectively the founder/ team could collect all the money received during ico + sell all their tokens no lock in period mentioned mvp/ dapp/ working product ,0
hostingicos.io, blockchain integration is not required for an ico listing platform ,0
hostingicos.io, the project is a dead rubber ,0
stoby.io, the whitepaper is quite interesting with an innovative offering ,1
stoby.io, this offering can and possibly will disrupt the given space of students part time job market ,0
stoby.io, the kyc of the students are easy to fill based on the universities id so it has great chances for scalability as well ,1
stoby.io, the white paper has almost all the details needed for an investor to make an investment decision but lacks specifics ,0
stoby.io, the core team is large and diverse but lacks a bit of experience in general ,0
stoby.io, they also have a good advisory board for ico but anything beyond that something to look forward to! tokenomics ,1
stoby.io, the token allocation and distribution is well within reasonable limits! they have a clear vesting period and a clear goal ,1
stoby.io, the business model is clear but lacks specifics about incentives for token holders ,0
stoby.io, ,1
stoby.io, working mvp! an intriguing project something which every youth can connect with and has the potential to be a market disruptor owing to the fact that interests in blockchain amongst youth population is sky high the timing of the project and also the future outlook!,1
aclyd.com, the whitepaper is quite cluttered but with a clear definition of token usage ,1
aclyd.com, the white paper has information about all the aspects but lacks specifics especially about partnerships that has been done or in pipeline ,0
aclyd.com, the core team has only 4 members with only the ceo having affiliation to the project as mentioned in li i hope it's not the case ,0
aclyd.com, the advisory members are illustrious but not sure how they can guide such a small team to success ,0
aclyd.com, basically 4 core team members with advisors raising money with a business plan and an mvp which should be enough but without partnerships the business is doomed ,1
aclyd.com, the information on team members is lacking and so doesn’t invoke any confidence as well ,0
aclyd.com, the tokenomics is pretty straight forward based on usage of tokens for various systems in the alcohol manufacturing and supply chain ,0
aclyd.com, the business model is not very clear as specifics are not mentioned ,0
aclyd.com, without a suitable development team and partners in the alcohol industry the business model is doomed ,0
aclyd.com, they have a mvp in place ,1
aclyd.com, the project is one which has potential but is more likely to fail than succeed due to non existent partners the have raised soft cap which would give them the required funds but it's actually difficult to see any progress in the context of business development ,0
aclyd.com, the team is not listed completely we have a decentralized team with members everywhere we have an interesting model which is we as advisors several of us have facilitated our tech legal and marketing workforce to the project but they are not listed there the other point i would argue is when you said the project is likely to fail well we have sold 35mm tokens and we have several pools coming our way while the concept is based on a working business ,1
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, the whitepaper is missing as of yet… ,0 
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, the core team is small and consists of experienced team members ,0
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, they perhaps lack a bit of experience in the marketing/pr and industry veterans as advisors both in travel and blockchain ,0
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, they are aiming to raise 10 but mind that it's a security token so well within rights to do such a thing! they also promise to share 50% profits with token holders 
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, this is where it would interesting to see how the allocation is made since founders/team and partners control most of the tokens ,0
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, the business model is clear ,0
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, they earn from tokens price increase based on 50% money injected in token economy + network value the details are yet to be ascertained ,0
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, no dapp or mvp yet ,0
lovelysuites-tokensale.com, but they have been in business for quite sometime! interesting project to look out for… ,1
give.si, the whitepaper is based on the actual product which is a platform for kids to learn about saving and investments coupled with good behaviour and a philanthropic cause ,1
give.si, the white paper has information about all the aspects but lacks specifics especially about partnerships that has been done or in pipeline ,0
give.si, the investment doesn’t hold value for the investors per say ,0
give.si, the core team is reputable and trustable ,1
give.si, the advisory members has been classified based on their roles which is a huge plus ,1
give.si, the tokenomics is pretty straight forward based on usage of tokens for various systems for the usage by kids ,1
give.si, the business model is not very clear as specifics are not mentioned ,0
give.si, in the roadmap explained in white paper a calculation has been showed based on which at the end of 10 years the valuation is between 600 700 million us$ which is a total fad in the absence of any clear business plan ,0
give.si, they have a mvp in place ,1
give.si, the project is well thought ,1
give.si, out but blockchain is an overkill for this project and is more or less a strategy for raising investments ,0
give.si, the economy is not self sustainable ,0
give.si, re: tokeneconomics based on one stable coin for the kids to exchange trade govern etc ,1
give.si, this coin is 'firewalled' through the foundation so that only kids can receive such tokens and can only purchase curated products more on that later and one token for the investors parents and partners anybody above 18 years old who want to support and access the give ,1
give.si, the give token is a tcr where partners will have to stake tokens if they want to access each school to be exposed to kids' purchasing power $300b ,1
give.si, the parent community of each school can curate voting with their token such partners and their products in a decentralized way ,1
give.si, re: business model in the slides i sent you you will see a full detail of the business model as well as a pnl related to it ,1
give.si, you can derive from our pnl the future valuation which should be a lot higher than the number you mentioned which was the amount that we estimate should be given to charities by kids ,1
give.si, re: use of blockchain the use of blockchain is paramount in this project for several reasons: 1 need of a close ended currency to protect the kids from purchasing unwanted products drugs etc 2 transparency is paramount so that all stakeholders have no doubt on the whereabouts of the funds allocated 3 decentralization is indispensable as no central entity should be handling the pocket money of 2.5b kids and we do want that each school economy can define themselves the stake holders that are members of that economy in a decentralized way 4 we are also working on a protocol of giving which purpose is to record all good deeds made by kids around the world so that the world can witness it ,1
viaz.io, the white paper problem and solution statement is very clear ,1
viaz.io, the idea of having a smart contract based lending platform isn’t new but the crypto collateral is quite interesting ,1
viaz.io, the white paper has failed to mention the specifics about lending ,0
viaz.io, the white paper has almost enough to educate investors about their project ,1
viaz.io, a bit more effort is needed to show investors the value of investing in this project in terms of expected roi generation with market penetration ,0
viaz.io, the team composition and advisory is small but capable inspite of that they seriously need to add team members for making it diverse in terms of pr marketing etc capabilities ,0
viaz.io, they have not mentioned the token generation amount and funds deployment as of yet ,0
viaz.io, the business model is clear ,1
viaz.io, use tokens as collateral to take loans and earn by keeping tokens as collateral but the rate of 1% p a as service fee is quite low to be honest and needs a detailed analysis if this amount is sufficient for the company to operate on the also lack ,0
viaz.io, a clear roadmap about reaching various markets and increasing user base ,0
viaz.io, they claim to come up with a test net before token emission ,1
viaz.io, the platform is live and operational ,1
viaz.io, great idea but small team composition and lack of specifics makes me wary ,0
viaz.io, the product is fully operational and acc to their team member ,1
viaz.io, yes fully on tezos alphanet the transfer etc all shows up on tezos blockchain,1
lifecharity.io, the white paper lacks specifics ,0
lifecharity.io, the best part is that they mention all of the money would be utilized for the charity but their tokenomics and funds deployment has been merged really weird! the white paper lacks the necessary details for investors to make an informed decision ,0
lifecharity.io, the core team is diverse and experienced but they need a stronger team to excel ,0
lifecharity.io, the token deployment has been merged with the fund's distribution and this is something they should really care about and re do it! business model ,0
lifecharity.io, the business model is clear but lacks specifics of any kind ,0
lifecharity.io, looks more like a charity token than a business proposition ,0
lifecharity.io, they have no working dapp ,0
lifecharity.io, the team should focus on building a more detailed whitepaper including partnership details proper token deployment funds deployment and especially focus on the value of investing in this ico all of which is found lacking!,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, the white paper is unique focussing on the product itself ,1
www.agrotechfarm.io, it is a very honest and simple white paper claiming that they are doing an ico as a means to just raise money ,1
www.agrotechfarm.io, the best part of this being the device would be launched regardless of the ico results ,1
www.agrotechfarm.io, now comes the difficult part the ico would be much more attractive for the investors if a the company could ensure all the machinery sold would be put on blockchain making it mandatory to use tokens for payment or they could do the conversion to tokens themselves ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, if they agreed to list the % of profit that would be reinvested to buy back tokens or the amount of profit to be shared with investors ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, they could have mentioned to have a supply chain on blockchain for organic products to be included in their app ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, the benefits that investors gain from investing in this token are clear but not quantified so difficult to calculate any roi ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, the team composition is filled with experienced personnel in their respective fields but then again no member from the team is having anything to do with blockchain so i wonder what kind of blockchain development could be undertaken in future including app ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, having at least a few members from blockchain developers in the core ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, team could have been an improvement ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, the token distribution is clearly stated and also the utilization of proceeds seems reasonable ,1
www.agrotechfarm.io, the soft cap and hard cap scenario is well represented and within reasonable limits ,1
www.agrotechfarm.io, as an investor quite troublesome to believe on the valuation of tokens as the tokens might or might not have any utility at all ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, equity token offering would have been better suited for this model of crypto fund raising ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, the utility model makes the investors vulnerable if the ico fails to deliver on its promise of buy back or ensure payments in tokens ,0
www.agrotechfarm.io, the unique ico has working model of their prototype equipments along with patents but no blockchain based mvp ,0
javvy.com, the white paper is simple yet clearly states everything in details in terms of process overview but lacks specifics in terms of financials ,0
javvy.com, it consists of enough details for investors to make an informed decision ,1
javvy.com, the team composition and advisory is a bit on the smaller side but capable ,1
javvy.com, the only drawback being the utilization of mostly freelancers for the platform development and including them in team profile this could seriously come back and haunt the team post production if there is any issues pertaining to the dapp ,0
javvy.com, their tokenomics as well as funds deployment is quite reasonable ,1
javvy.com, although a better way could have been to show a min optimum and maximum spending based on soft cap and hard cap range since soft cap and hard cap varies quite a bit ,0
javvy.com, the business model lacks clarity as to how the dapp would earn money ,0
javvy.com, the business idea is to earn money from service fee kyc accreditation fee etc but not how much could be the profit based on customer acquisition this would greatly enhance the white paper as investors could be able to make a guess about their roi ,0
javvy.com, they have a working mvp ,1
coin.carsmartt.com, the white paper is simple precise and professionally done ,1
coin.carsmartt.com, the best part is they are doing a reverse ico,1
coin.carsmartt.com, they already have a platform and they are adding blockchain capabilities to it not an overkill in anyways ,1
coin.carsmartt.com, the idea itself is simple but innovative and the positive environmental impact would be significant as well ,1
coin.carsmartt.com, the drawback is that they have failed to mention any details about their existing business ,0
coin.carsmartt.com, the white paper has the necessary details for investors to make an informed decision ,1
coin.carsmartt.com, the core team is knowledgeable but lacks a bit of diversity in terms of team members ,0
coin.carsmartt.com, the advisory team members are credible too but lack specifics regarding engagement with the ico ,0
coin.carsmartt.com, the funds' deployment and token allocation are within reasonable limits ,1
coin.carsmartt.com, the business model is clear but lacks specifics of any kind ,0
coin.carsmartt.com, the lack of mention about existing business and partnerships is a concern ,0
coin.carsmartt.com, they have a working app ,1
www.beercoin.codes, the white paper is simple and resembles an essay on the introduction of token economy in the beer industry it neither describes the needs for blockchain implementation nor the future business model this makes it a big risk for investors team ,0
www.beercoin.codes, the team composition doesn’t contain experienced blockchain engineers or experts and mostly they are happy explaining their interests in the kinds of beer they like ,0
www.beercoin.codes, seriously investors don’t wanna hear what you like but how could you solve an issue and make the product successful which is lacking! ,0
www.beercoin.codes, the tokenomics is easy to understand including the mining part but then why implement blockchain??? a normal token would be enough! clarification? ,0
www.beercoin.codes, the business model is easy to understand initially but since these coins are minable what happens when all of the coins run out as the code once printed wouldn’t be utilized again? they have taken a 10 year period into account for this calculation which means they are not very serious about long term goals ,0
www.beercoin.codes, the investors have no idea what they are investing in and why? ,0
www.beercoin.codes, the company has a working application ,1
www.beercoin.codes, but no partnerships mentioned with any micro breweries or established breweries which is a big cause of concern ,0
www.moolyacoin.io, the white paper is simple and professionally done with much interests,1 
www.moolyacoin.io, the white paper details almost all aspects necessary for an investor to make a decision ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, the business plan is solid and although it lacks some visual flair but it more than makes it up with a powerful patent ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, pending platform offering ,0
www.moolyacoin.io, the team composition is superb although a bit localized ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, the ico team has members investing in the platform themselves before going forward with fund raising a rarity in icos ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, with 9 members passing the kyc its amongst the highest if not the highest amongst all ico’s i have seen ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, the team is more than capable to deliver on the platform they promise but it would be interesting to note how they grow beyond regional boundaries ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, the tokenomics is simple and the spending is justified due to the uniqueness of the ico ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, the only point i would like to raise here is the high % of tokens allocated to advisors token % is same for both founders and advisors ,0
www.moolyacoin.io, the business model is very clear ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, once the ico is over the tokens would be the currency in use inside the platform making the whole process transparent and profitable for investors ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, mvp/ working product available makes this project very attractive to invest in bonus point ,1
www.moolyacoin.io, besides the impeccable team and the business model the partnerships they have forged is hugely important and it makes this ico stand out amongst the crowd ,1
dclinic.io, the white paper is simple and accurate ,1
dclinic.io, the amount and time spent on developing various components are both logical and within reasons ,1
dclinic.io, a commendable job indeed ,1
dclinic.io, the team has invested 2.5 million us$ which is also a positive trend ,1
dclinic.io, the partnerships are credible and provides a strong base to launch from ,1
dclinic.io, but although there is an adequate level of information for any investor in all the aspects including liquidity advantages etc it lacks specifics ,0
dclinic.io, how much % of profit would be shared? which are the exchanges they want to launch in? they acknowledge they would get listed in an exchange first and then expand ,0
dclinic.io, an eight member team with an illustrious advisory committee is quite commendable ,1
dclinic.io, team is incapable of pulling such a huge project off by itself ,1
dclinic.io, the tokenomics revolves around a unique sense of utility token with a share of profit as dividend from both earning and real estate ,1
dclinic.io, it would have been much easier to do the fundraising using equity token and a secondary coin for the internal platform use ,0
dclinic.io, both the token distribution and fund allocation is within reasonable limit ,1
dclinic.io, the business model is kind of okey since they have a lot of components built for the platform which they are leveraging ,1
dclinic.io, but it lacks clarity in terms of future business development plans on global scale ,0
dclinic.io, the fundraising looks more like a way of raising capital but the amount of profit share with investors is still in the dark ,0
dclinic.io, the positive things about this project is its multiple working components ,1
www.ptcs.io, the white paper is quite detailed in its offering and outlook ,1
www.ptcs.io, the application of blockchain is understable for the part of pet breeding and sales besides integration of blockchain for the pet market is an overkill ,0
www.ptcs.io, the services offered can be done by an app and token ,0
www.ptcs.io, data sharing of pet healthcare or pet products and the promise of individual platform with multiple language can be independent of blockchain without potential downside ,0
www.ptcs.io, the team composition is quite good with experience personnel from the relevant industry with a few advisors as well ,1
www.ptcs.io, the team is small in composition and lacks diversity in terms of marketing pr capabilities and information is hard to find about some members ,0
www.ptcs.io, the tokenomics is not very clear ,0
www.ptcs.io, they plan to sell 90 million tokens out of 180 million so no comments about the remaining 50% tokens is it for founders/ team? if so it very greedy besides the fate of unsold tokens has to be stated? ,0
www.ptcs.io, the funds allocation seems okey except an unusually high amount 30% is saved as security of the token ,0
www.ptcs.io, the business model is very clear ,1
www.ptcs.io, once the ico is over the tokens would be the currency in use inside the platform making the whole process transparent and profitable for investors since they plan to get money from pet products advertisers ,1
www.ptcs.io, but no mention about potential tie ups with any pet product company ,0
www.ptcs.io, they have an mvp already ,1
www.ptcs.io, the idea is not original but the approach of tackling the problems is! a capable team but only selling 50% as utility tokens for investors makes it a project with high risk ,0
www.ptcs.io, the team should clearly explain a roadmap proper token allocation and why they have such a huge gap between soft cap and hard cap ,0
swinca.io, the white paper is quite complete in problem definition and solution aspect but lacks a few specifics ,0
swinca.io, a clear outline about the advantages of investing in this project it also talks about the maintaining of liquidity of the coins including additional discounts for token lock in ,1
swinca.io, but fails to explain why 50% tokens allocated for masternode and pools ,0
swinca.io, the white paper has almost all details for investors to make an informed decision ,1
swinca.io, the kyc is incomplete ,1
swinca.io, the team members and advisors are suitable but nothing spectacular ,0
swinca.io, they have full time team 10 members working on this please provide complete details of team members ,0
swinca.io, the tokenomics is a bit weird ,0
swinca.io, they have 50% tokens for masternode and pools which is not explained well ,0
swinca.io, they have extra discount for token lock in ,1
swinca.io, they have pre ico value of 0.1us$ and value for investors in ico as 0.6 us$ a big rip ,0
swinca.io, off for later investors ,0
swinca.io, they do not burn tokens but keep it vested for long term ,1
swinca.io, they have 60% for buying properties 15% as reserve and 25% as operational cost operational cost is a bit high but can be justified if they have proper documentation to support it ,0
swinca.io, the business model is quite clear with examples ,1
swinca.io, they have working mvp ,1
gcox.com, the white paper is quite clear about the objectives but lacks a clear roadmap related to advantages for investors and strong business plan post ico,0 
gcox.com, the benefits that investors gain from investing in this token are not clear ,0
gcox.com, the team composition is filled with heavy hitters but then again most of them don’t have clear commitments to the project as evident from their link ,0
gcox.com, makes me a skeptic about the objective of doing a private sale and ico without a mvp after so much investments/ commitments ,0
gcox.com, the token distribution is clearly stated and also the utilization of proceeds seems reasonable ,1
gcox.com, no soft cap or hard cap just a bunch of scenario in pitch deck! as an investor quite troublesome to believe on the valuation of tokens ,0
gcox.com, having michael owen and manny pacquiao amongst others as their celebrity is quite appealing but it would have been much better if this ico stated that they have acquired these celebrity on the platform and verified by the celebrities themselves rather than as brand ambassadors which seems the most likely case any clarifications would help! ,0
gcox.com, due to the absence of any working product/ mvp the ico represents more of an idea than an actual reality ,0
www.gigtricks.io, the white paper is professionally presented outlying the problem and need for a blockchain based kyc rating escrow technology etc required in the freelance industry ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the ico has raised its soft cap ,0
www.gigtricks.io, the business model for investors is to the point and scalable over time ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the team composition doesn’t reflect blockchain capabilities but the team is experienced in their respective industry this makes it strong and possibly able to deliver on their promises of integrating blockchain based capabilities in the product platform ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the tokenomics is easy to understand including the reasonable use of funds ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the business model is quite direct and they already have clearcut use cases ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the more people join this platform the better it is for the token economy which is self sustainable to begin with ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the company has a working platform already which is a plus ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the blockchain integration and scalability is a cause of concern for smooth transition ,0
www.gigtricks.io, investors investing early could potentially reap multiple returns!,1
bitozz.com, the white paper is professionally done and deals with setting up a crypto exchange to begin with ,1
bitozz.com, the best part is that this exchange allows traders to pay a one time fee for trading as well as leverage up to 25x without carrying cost which is cool ,1
bitozz.com, the white paper has all the necessary details but lacks a bit more specifics for investors to make an informed decision ,0
bitozz.com, the core team is solid without being extraordinary with a good advisory board ,1
bitozz.com, they lack a well diversified team and depth in the squad ,0
bitozz.com, the token and funds deployment are within reasonable limits ,1
bitozz.com, the business model is clear but lacks specifics of any kind ,0
bitozz.com, they want to give 10% of profits earned to token holders as dividends monthly and do a token burn out quarterly with 10% of exchange profit dividends are always cool! but having both these doesn't make any sense ,0
bitozz.com, they probably have a working mvp ,1
bitozz.com, the project needs a lot of effort to work and might be a success in the long run being a crypto exchange but the token holders have to see if they really value this project as its not much different from other exchanges and the profit would come from volumes that this exchange could generate ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, the white paper is professionally done and deals with lucrative sponsorship market ,1
www.instantsponsor.com, the problem definition is related to the cost and delay for brokering a sponsorship deal in the sporting industry ,1
www.instantsponsor.com, the white paper has all the necessary details but lacks a bit more specifics for investors to make an informed decision ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, the core team is experienced in this area ,1
www.instantsponsor.com, they have a well diversified team but their blockchain capabilities are lacking with this team both in terms of people from developers to influencers ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, the token and funds deployment are within reasonable limits ,1
www.instantsponsor.com, the only point being they having 15% for team and also 8% for partnership + 14% for community growth the better option would have been to reserve some % for future partnership for selling it to them ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, the business model is quite clear but lacks specifics ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, what happens with the transaction fees? does the token holders get any incentives for holding the token? does the profit gets shared with token holders as far as i can say the only incentive is if the platform becomes successful and token explodes ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, also they have not mentioned any partnership details either with a team or an individual ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, clarifications? i guess usecases doesnt count for partnerships and product building ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, they probably have a working mvp but havent shared the link yet ,0
www.instantsponsor.com, the project needs a lot of effort to work and might be a success in the long run but the token holders have to be patient if they do invest as this is a project with a big vision and long term goals!,1
one-fund.io, the white paper is doesn’t give much confidence in investing in the ico as it lacks the specifics ,0
one-fund.io, also for this offering to work it needs a healthy share of ico’s to work with this platform ,0
one-fund.io, the idea could potentially work if they have partners and no mention of any partnership ,0
one-fund.io, the team has 3 members of which 2 has their affiliations with one share token ,1
one-fund.io, the tokenomics revolves around profits from investments of one share fund imagine a scenario someone invests in this fund quite heavily and then use the platforms power to vote for investing in a scam for personal benefit or by mistake the consequences are disastrous ,0
one-fund.io, the business model is like a gamble on the token holders to make correct decisions ,0
one-fund.io, the fund can or cannot perform based on the dapp voting ,0
one-fund.io, overall it’s a whitepaper with 2 founders and an affiliate as a team in it and so it’s better to do additional research if you do want to invest in this vague ico ,0
433token.io, the white paper is detailed and professionally done ,1
433token.io, the best part is that they mention the specific partnerships with renowned ex footballers but it would great if they could come out openly and mention the 433 ico project in their social media platforms! ,0
433token.io, the white paper contains all the details necessary for making an informed decision about ico investing ,1

433token.io, the business model is clear ,1
433token.io, the best part is fans can take part in nurturing talents meeting ex footballing greats watching matches and just have an inclusive feeling something which is lacking in the modern day football ,1
433token.io, the team should focus on getting some partnerships going with a football club as well ,0
433token.io, they have no working dapp as of now ,0

www.demars.io, the kyc is incomplete ,0
www.demars.io, the team members and advisors doesnt have affiliations to the ico 
www.demars.io, a big red flag ,0
www.demars.io, almost no information about token allotment and funds deployment ,0
www.demars.io, lack of any business model ,0
www.demars.io, lack of any information except on the roadmap ,0
www.demars.io, the team is mostly consisting of engineering team blockchain app development etc with hardly many marketing team at this moment which is understandable given the project is in very early stage ,0
www.demars.io, the technical team is impeccable ,1
www.demars.io, but has a bad marketing effort ,0
www.demars.io, the whitepaper is really technical as it was meant to be so ,1
www.demars.io, they are working on the one pager for tokenomics but basically this is a tool for money remittance quickly and cheaply starting from the african region ,1
www.demars.io, the technology is really unique which can utilize little data and not comparable with pow or pos ,1
www.demars.io, clean and green! the stages of development includes architechture planning completed with a poc network building on going and application development not yet ,0
www.demars.io, the team says everyone is ready to ride the train but we are currently laying down the tracks and needs support for it ,1
www.demars.io, i believe this project has huge potential but to attract genuine investors they need to update things! ,1
redi.io, the white paper is based on providing an infrastructure for the integration and measurements of renewable energy starting with solar energy this would lead to a greater efficiency in this sector leading to greater adoption and improved sustainability ,1
redi.io, the white paper is well done classifying all the problems plaguing this sector and the roadmap ahead for solving some of them ,1
redi.io, the technicals are well explained with suitable examples ,1
redi.io, it contains all the relevant materials for an investor to review this meritorious project ,1
redi.io, the core team is reputable and trustable ,1
redi.io, the advisory members too are quite experienced,1 
redi.io, but the drawback is the team is too heavy on a regional basis ,0
redi.io, for the project to expand globally a global advisory members was the necessity ,1
redi.io, the token deployment and funding allocation are within reasonable limits although about 20% is reserved for bonuses which could have been included in the token sale at present it seems that only 30% is available for sale but the actual number is 50% or so no mention has been done about the fate of the unsold tokens ,0
redi.io, the business model is quite clear ,1
redi.io, the team has strong partnerships but to expand globally it needs to tie up with partners from other geographical locations ,0
redi.io, also its not easy to ask different business/ organizations to part with their data so easily which could be a hurdle ,0
redi.io, they have a mvp in place ,1
masternodeinvest.io, the white paper is based on procuring investments on masternode ,1
masternodeinvest.io, the website states that its an sto that will be recognized by finma/mfsa but on the other hand talk of doing air drops which is strange!,0
masternodeinvest.io, no one should want to give away stos for free ,0
masternodeinvest.io, clarifications??? the project is well thought out with a strong and fruitful idea ,1
masternodeinvest.io, the specifics provided is enough for making an investment decision ,1
masternodeinvest.io, the core team is experienced along with a capable advisory board ,1
masternodeinvest.io, nothing too glamorous but competent ,1
masternodeinvest.io, the token and funds deployment are within reasonable limits ,1
masternodeinvest.io, in fact the only question is the lack of lock in period for team members ,0
masternodeinvest.io, they are already charging a pool fee from incomes generated so a tiered lock in period for team would have made sense ,0
masternodeinvest.io, the business model is quite clear ,1
masternodeinvest.io, the future plan and partnerships need to be mentioned including place of operations ,0
masternodeinvest.io, no mvp/ working product is required since its masternode investments a link to existing masternodes could have been provided to win investors trust ,0
masternodeinvest.io, the project needs a lot of effort to work and might be a success but due to the proliferation of fake icos it would be difficult to convince investors unless a whale/ institutional investor joins and the team provides relevant reasons for the large gap in soft cap and hard cap ,0
masternodeinvest.io, basically they could just do it as a long term open ico for funds collection or do a private sale followed by masternode invest show returns and do a ico ,1
liker.world, the white paper is based on education market ,1
liker.world, the project is well thought out with a strong and fruitful idea ,1
liker.world, the specifics provided is enough for making an investment decision ,1
liker.world, the core team is quite experienced along with a strong advisory board ,1
liker.world, the only issue is a strong regional bias ,0
liker.world, the token and funds deployment are within reasonable limits ,1
liker.world, the lack of specifics is a worry ,0
liker.world, like they have failed to mention the quantity in pre sale and ico phase future plans for exchange listing is also lacking ,0
liker.world, the business model is quite clear ,1
liker.world, the future plan and partnerships are mentioned but needs further details ,1
liker.world, no mvp ,0
liker.world, the project needs a lot of effort to work and might be a success in the eastern and south eastern asian region but global presence can be quite difficult to achieve ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the white paper is based on decentralizing the freelancer market ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, this projects is just an idea as of yet ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, it contains some relevant materials for an investor but lacks specifics ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the core team is inexperienced and does not have relevant know ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, how to make this project work ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the advisor is also unrelated to the industry ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the token deployment are within reasonable limits ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, but the biggest problem lies in the funding allocation part ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the founder core team reserves 10% of the tokens and on top they also take 30% of the funding received ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, this is clearly unprofessional ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the business model is quite clear but without the specifics ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the future plan and partnerships are not mentioned ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, no mvp ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, the term specifics in your claims seems unclear to us and i will love you to examine how the whole freelance platforms operate ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, you also claimed its just an idea a statement i will also disagree to even though everything we use in the world today started as an idea as well ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, we're selling our ideas out so as to raise the funds to make it happen via ico ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, we all have different intra/interpersonal skills and i really don't expect we list all our skills to disfigure our website or whitepaper ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, i am the founder and i have been a freelancer for almost 4 years as well as a crypto trader ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, i understand how freelancing works and i've experienced the problems existing around the platforms which we also highlighted to solve with our on platform ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, besides don't forget we also indicated that we will be hiring more teams as time goes on and this was stated on our roadmap and we also added our hiring mail ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, the platform/community to be needs huge amount of staffs and technicians and we are aware of this ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, regarding our advisor he has been in the space for long as well and has partnered in other blockchain related projects making him fully understood what we aim to achieve with our project ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, from our whitepaper we stated that the token allocation for team and ecosystem will be locked for 5 years looking into the 30% which was been set for team/miscellaneous this will be used to hire staffs/technicians and to expand the team on the long run ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, in our whitepaper we stated that we will be in partnerships other payment processors with companies schools and lots more even though none was disclosed ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, this is on our roadmap and we have our own strategies to achieve this and i see no reason why this should be a worry as well ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, if you visited our main website you will notice we have our mvp as a demo at as well as a flowchart of how the platform will operate available in our whitepaper ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, we're selling our ideas out so as to raise the funds to make it happen via ico ,1
www.pensionrewards.com, the team does not have a product yet but a vision ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, 5 years token lock in is good instead of 30% for team/miscellaneous please replace it by operational cost makes more sense i quote the 30% will be for both core team hiring professionals staffs [it's a company to be] and building of the company structures and equipments as well better rephrase it as operational costs for simplicity] ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, i can't judge the team based on their li profile but none have experience in running a freelancer site including adviser,0 
www.pensionrewards.com, judging from that it's difficult to know about the capabilities ,0
www.pensionrewards.com, no partnership was disclosed accepted by the team members and the mvp is a demo ,0
makapuno.co, the white paper is based on biomass production and its utility ,1
makapuno.co, blockchain integration is an overkill to this project and probably a gimmick for fundraising through ico ,0
makapuno.co, it contains all the relevant materials for an investor to review it ,1
makapuno.co, the core team is experienced and trustable ,1
makapuno.co, but having only 4 members makes me realise all the blockchain developments has been outsourced ,0
makapuno.co, the token deployment and funding allocation are within reasonable limits ,1
makapuno.co, the low bonuses means the company is serious about taking these investments and not just another project off the blocks ,1
makapuno.co, the business model is quite clear without any specifics no partnerships no future roadmaps and no information as to how they will make the tokens work beside treating them as investments ,0
makapuno.co, nothing about blockchain based mvp as well ,0
icotravelvee.com, the white paper is apt and to the point ,1
icotravelvee.com, the best part is that they are not charging users instead of charging hotels but that too only after the hotels get confirmed reservations from the platform ,1
icotravelvee.com, the idea is simple but innovative ,1
icotravelvee.com, the drawback is that they have failed to mention any partnerships ,0
icotravelvee.com, the white paper has lacked the necessary details for investors to make an informed decision ,0
icotravelvee.com, the core team is has very little information about it with an abject lack of any advisory members from the travel or crypto community they lack a well diversified team and depth in the squad ,0

icotravelvee.com, the token deployment is not mentioned showing the ignorance of the team or probably lack of experience in this regard ,0
icotravelvee.com, the business model is clear but lacks specifics of any kind ,0
icotravelvee.com, the lack of partnership is the biggest concern ,0
icotravelvee.com, they probably have a working business but not much is mentioned in this regard ,0
icotravelvee.com, the project needs a lot of effort to work and might be a success in the long run being a niche area ,1
icotravelvee.com,but the token holders have to see if they really value this project as it's not providing much information ,0
protocol.please.com, the white paper has outlined the problems related to the tourism industry and outlined possible solutions of pre designed yet customized travel trips ,1

protocol.please.com, they already have a fully working product ,1
www.embleema.com, the white paper has outlined the problems plaguing the healthcare industry and outlined possible solutions to tackle the problems in a structured manner ,1
www.embleema.com, the benefits of using blockchain have been well established in healthcare sector not an original idea! but the twist is to focus on particular areas to find wider acceptance ,1
www.embleema.com, the white paper almost has all the details for investors to make an informed decision ,1
www.embleema.com, the core team is competent along with a small advisory board ,1
www.embleema.com, the team is loaded with visible experience in the healthcare industry ,1
www.embleema.com, but lacks members capable to fulfill all requirements like blockchain engineers pr marketing people etc ,0
www.embleema.com, the token allotment is quite skewed ,0
www.embleema.com, they have 30% tokens for token sale 7% tokens for marketing of ico 48% tokens a rather hefty amount for incentivizing data owners and network growth and 15% tokens for founders ,1
www.embleema.com, founders token are vested over a period of 5 years a huge positive compared to other icos ,1
www.embleema.com, funds allocation is within reasonable limits and management team takes a further 13% from raised funds so effectively the founders have 15% tokens + 13% from raised funds which is a bit on the higher side but acceptable ,1
www.embleema.com, the business model requires partnerships and collaborations which has been clearly highlighted including patient advocacy group cystic fibrosis community pharmaceuticals pilot with pierre fabre group etc ,1
www.embleema.com, a big positive for any project ,1
www.embleema.com, but they have failed to mention advantages for investors ,0
www.embleema.com, how do you plan to incentivize investors to hold the coin? not clear ,0
www.embleema.com, they already have a fully functional working prototype ,1
www.embleema.com, the idea is not original but the approach of tackling the problems is! a capable team but only selling 30% as utility tokens for investors makes it a project with long term benefits ,1
www.embleema.com, the team should clearly explain benefits for investors which is lacking…,0 
www.embleema.com, firstly : no competitors as we know as of today are able to show a real live product like we do at embleema inc ,1
www.embleema.com, you can check the code and the contracts on github ,1
www.embleema.com, we've made the choice to spend our money in our product first not into communication with a nice whitepaper our live product is actually our first marketing asset ,1
www.embleema.com, secondly : as i said earlier not only we do have a product but we are able to sell it ! ,1
www.embleema.com, we just signed our first major client : pierre fabre pharma 2.5 billions turnover yearly ,1
www.embleema.com, we will announce other major clients soon we're just waiting for the pr to be validated ,1
www.embleema.com, several other business proposals are in discussions with governments and other big pharmas vps and ceos ,1

rebglo.io, the white paper has outlined the problem plaguing the crypto mining industry as a subset of energy industry as a whole ,1

rebglo.io, but no information has been provided about the testing beyond the % improvement in performance ,0
rebglo.io, there is a lack of information for any investor in all the aspects including location of mining farm future business model even lack of complete team member list etc ,0
rebglo.io, the team consists of two members with an advisory committee ,1
rebglo.io, i hope this is actually not the case two founders with a white paper!!! clarifications? ,0
rebglo.io, the tokenomics revolve around sharing 30% of the net profit as air drops increasing inflation of the coins overtime ,0
rebglo.io, would have been a better choice if they used 30% of the net profit for buy back and token burn out to guarantee rise of the coin price ,0
rebglo.io, very unattractive for early investors ,0
rebglo.io, the business model is kind of okey since they have a product which they are leveraging ,1
rebglo.io, but it lacks clarity in terms of business development plans method of authenticating profits to be shared as this is not on blockchain etc ,0
rebglo.io, not enough information provided for investors ,0
rebglo.io, no working model yet or even an mvp on the crypto ,0
rebglo.io, rig but it works on a mobile cell phone doesn’t qualify it as a mvp still… ,0

www.satt-token.com, the tokens have vesting periods and also the remaining unsold tokens would be burnt post ico ,1
www.satt-token.com, the only potential red flags are a very high discount to early investors 100% bonus and 50% bonus with no vesting period so as soon as the tokens hit the exchanges early investors can make a killing off the retail investors by selling it cheaper than the price of retail investors purchase price ,0
www.satt-token.com, the business model requires partnerships and collaborations which has been clearly highlighted ,1
www.satt-token.com, they already have a running business with a million users ,1
www.satt-token.com, a big positive for any project ,1
www.satt-token.com, the commissions charged on using the tokens in the environment will the system self sustainable ,1

www.satt-token.com, they already have a mvp ,1
www.satt-token.com, this project can be considered as a reverse ico,1
www.satt-token.com, they have business and revenue worth 500000 us$ and plan to expand further using the token sale proceedings ,1
www.satt-token.com, the idea is a great with a capable team and good business,1
www.satt-token.com, but high bonuses in early stage and a lack of advantage for investors besides waiting for the ecosystem to grow makes it a project with long term benefits rather than one with a short term gain ,1
www.satt-token.com, in view of the updated kyc and extended team members list along with a fully functional platform with wallet and token usage on this platform available ,1
www.farm2kitchen.io, the white paper has outlined the problem plaguing supply chain in food industry,1

www.farm2kitchen.io, the tokenomics is easy to understand including the reasonable use of funds ,1
www.farm2kitchen.io, the tokens have vesting period for both advisors and founders with 10% each for both ,1

www.farm2kitchen.io, no information ,0
www.farm2kitchen.io, the business model requires partnerships and collaborations which has not been highlighted ,0
www.farm2kitchen.io, requires the active participation from various fields for the tokens to be self sustainable ,0
www.farm2kitchen.io, the buyback offer is good for investors but achieving operational profit by 2020 is a bit too soon ,0
www.farm2kitchen.io, generally a successful product based ico breaks even by 3 5 years unless it’s an exchange clarifications? ,0
www.farm2kitchen.io, no working model yet or even an mvp this makes the project a bit on the weaker side despites ,0
www.farm2kitchen.io, its promising idea and strong team ,1
www.farm2kitchen.io, kyc passed ,1
www.farm2kitchen.io, it’s a b2b project ,1
www.farm2kitchen.io, it’s a democratic solution and we don’t expect the cost of food to go up significantly with this ,1
www.farm2kitchen.io, the idea is the restaurants will pay the same what they pay right not but just cut out too many middlemen ,0
www.farm2kitchen.io, partnership with moolyacoin for scaling ,1
www.farm2kitchen.io, re rating the project again based on the information like ieo adding team members and ofcourse an mvp which looks simple and attractive ,1

veritag.org, requires the active participation from various fields for the tokens to be self sustainable ,0
veritag.org, a bit more clarification on the business model would help investors on having a clear view ,0
veritag.org, cloud based working model is available! they have all the required ammunation to capture the se asian market for sure if not global market ,1
veritag.org, the team has to expand significantly for that very positive outlook for the project itself ,1

thefarmtoken.com, the white paper has a clear goal of future business development but lacks specifics ,0
thefarmtoken.com, the team composition consists of four persons i seriously hope it isn’t the case clarify ,0
thefarmtoken.com, advisory is kind of lightweight in terms of ico or food related expertise ,0
thefarmtoken.com, the tokenomics is easy to understand including the reasonable use of funds ,1
thefarmtoken.com, the good thing is that they do not limit the tokens and the tokens would be split when and if price reaches 10 us$ ,1
thefarmtoken.com, they are giving 40% discounts for pre ico investors and doesn’t mention any vesting period ,0
thefarmtoken.com, the business model requires partnerships and collaborations which has not been highlighted ,0

www.kubitx.io,whilst there are a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges already available if they can manage to achieve 12 million + transactions per second then of course the potential is massive ,1
www.kubitx.io, a fairly strong team leading it as well it's going to be interesting to see this develop further ,1
bips.moneybrain.com,whilst the team is rather large i feel there are still many resources missing ,0
bips.moneybrain.com, no point having a big team whilst leaving out key resources ,0
bips.moneybrain.com, the gap between the softcap and hardcap is massive ,0
bips.moneybrain.com, could you guys perhaps elaborate on how you would be able to deliver a product with only the softcap amount of 100eth if you are able to do this then what is the need for the 50 000eth in the hardcap?,0
bips.moneybrain.com, also on your core team you have simon dempsey and daniel butler and in your advisory panel you have tim dempsey and jon butler is this coincidental or are both dempsey's and both butlers related?,0
twogap.com,whilst the advisors are exceptional they will not be the ones executing the project ,0
twogap.com, that core team lacks evidence of their skills and experience to execute a project of this nature ,0
twogap.com, i think the vision is sound ,1
twogap.com, but the so called prototype shows nothing really other than some column and row headings and click buttons ,0
goldencurrency.world,whilst not the first in this space these guys do appear to understand the need for independent verification of gold ,1
goldencurrency.world, the number of issued golden and their compliance with the amount of gold in depository will be subject to regular audit the results of which will be publicly published ,1
goldencurrency.world, how many of these other outfits even hint at auditing in their white papers? again i only trust gold i hold in my hands ,0
goldencurrency.world, but this ico seems to be one of the least worst in the gold backed space ,0
uchit.info,while this seems like a good idea on paper the fact that ethereum is being used might be shortsighted and dangerous ,0
uchit.info, i can see multiple issues with: connectivity throughput responsiveness ,0
uchit.info, speed it is not easy to see the advantages of a blockchain here ,0
uchit.info, this might be faster more stable and easier to build with a traditional client server model ,0
b21.io,while there are many exchanges there is little to no competition in the personal wealth market which targets the general public ,1
b21.io, we are a simple to use platform geared fro non technical users ,1
b21.io, our team is highly experienced at large scale financial systems ,1
b21.io, we wee the inventors of the crypto linked debits cards used by xapo wirex bitpay and many more ,1
seal.network,while the ico team needs to provide more information on their offering a study of their product would show a limited use ,0
seal.network, their promise is a verification works if brands would join in their platform and then it adopts the company's seal chips and then this should be rolled out in retail stores ,0
seal.network, this presents a classic scenario where we company must show that they have incoming partners already ,0
seal.network, so far the ico has not yet sufficiently done this ,0
lyfe.health,while many below have criticized the team i think a team of 2/3 core individuals is about rightl for a startup ,1
lyfe.health, generally a company like this would deal with various freelancers and subcontractors none of whom would be worth mentioning as part of the core team ,1
lyfe.health, its quite easy for a team to list a large number of subcontractors etc if they were trying to be deceptive ,1
lyfe.health, the co founder has a lot of experience in this space and they appear to be related this means they likely have a good team dynamic and are bonded with something greater than a business ,1
lyfe.health, to me that makes a strong team ,1
lyfe.health, if you want to know more however their whitepaper has more details on the team with regard to vision i would say lyfe isnt the only game in town here but the concept is certainly decent and it clearly makes sense why blockchain would benefit a model like this its similar i suppose to credit card rewards but for health,1
lyfe.health, the product mvp doesent have to be functional ,1
lyfe.health, there is a long history of icobench projects linking to mockup apps the point of this is to illustrate how the sysem would work and what the model is getting to a working product is what they are raising money for and the softcap doesent seem outrageous to me to either ,1
lyfe.health, the numbers seem fair id recommend this ico,1
ironblock.io,while i kind of like the idea and totally understand it, 1
ironblock.io,i fail to see anything listed here that might make me comfortable about investing in this ico from kyc to mvp work needs to be done there before one can ask for crypto community to support the project with pledges ,0
www.embleema.com,while i agree that such a health care blockchain can be vital to improving the healthcare system ,1
www.embleema.com, i have one very fundermental questions if there exists so many so call health care blockchain can the differnt chains actually share their data seemlessly between one another? what if different hospitals decided to go onto different chains assuming mix of both ethereum and other private chains ? ,0
 www.embleema.com, i do however love the vision of embleema but above issue is something we still need to consider ,0
www.embleema.com, team wise kyc has pass not the best of team but still good ,1
www.embleema.com, may need one or two expert of bc as advisor to add some credibility ,0
www.embleema.com, putting that aside the importance of this is network externalities or how to get it which means how to get patients to onboard as well as hospitals to participate ,0
www.embleema.com, in the end it should be the largest chain in the country or area that would win for example say largest in paris then most hospitals in paris would join the system ,1
www.embleema.com, product wise mvp and timeline avail so a 4 is rewarded ,1
www.skyfchain.io,while everyone is reinventing the wheel by copying existing businesses skyfchain innovates ,1
www.skyfchain.io, great job good project ,1
www.skyfchain.io, business to robots is incredibly innovative ,1
www.skyfchain.io, wish you best of luck,1
universalprotocol.io,while btc and ethereum will be losing their supremacy finding ways to create paths between various blockchain will be a real must have so universal protocol is going to be well positioned ,1
universalprotocol.io, opening their interoperability to other assets later will give it even more utility ,1
universalprotocol.io, giving tools to add some human proof security is a real mandatory too loss of password death even more in a b2b use ,1
universalprotocol.io, real use cases with real and detailed technical solutions ,1
universalprotocol.io, big names in the alliance: bittrex brave cred blockchain at berkeley… which is great and reinsuring in the quality of the project ,1
universalprotocol.io, token used like bnb: reduced fees voting right and some access to service ,1
universalprotocol.io, may then be used a lot but with a high velocity ,1
universalprotocol.io, no burning like bnb ,1
universalprotocol.io, so unsure how the price may react ,1
universalprotocol.io, extensive whitepaper ,1
universalprotocol.io, but no mvp while the project is launch from months ,0
universalprotocol.io, the team seems of quality experienced and big enough for such a project ,1
universalprotocol.io, public sale is 300k tokens while there are more than 10000k tokens in supply so public buyers will be very very small comparing to the total supply only 3% ,0
universalprotocol.io, there is no information on the conditions of the former private sale 600k tokens sold and on the future sales when why how much ,0
universalprotocol.io, 54% of the tokens are held by the alliance members that’s huge and could be a red flag in many other ico ,0
universalprotocol.io, maybe it's just to keep the voting right which would then be very centralized but it's a big concern ,0
medicohealth.io,while blockchains are attracting attention for their integration with various fields development is concentrated on match ups with medical care and development is desired from now on ,1
medicohealth.io, this project aims to integrate blockchain and medical care ,1
medicohealth.io, team members are well ,1
medicohealth.io, balanced and have a clear vision ,1
medicohealth.io, they have an advantage in technology and have already received angel investment ,1
medicohealth.io, this will be a big flag for investors ,1
b21.io, how cluttered it is whether there is space for more players and so on,0
aircraft.travel,whether the project on the trip succeeds or not depends on whether the project has established operational methods with international team members ,1
aircraft.travel, there are elements to succeed such as highly reliable platforms and invitations to events ,1
aircraft.travel, a special nfc module for payment bracelet is also a unique idea ,1
aircraft.travel, hard caps are huge ,0
aircraft.travel,but soft caps are realistic ,1
aircraft.travel, i long for the announcement of mvp scheduled soon ,1
www.kairos.com,where's the team tab on their website ,0
www.kairos.com, not sure who's behind kairos ,0
pixelcharity.com,where ,0
pixelcharity.com, when ,0
p2l.tv,where to buy,0
sonder.vision,where to begin ,0
sonder.vision, the whitepaper has apparently been translated from another language because the grammar and sentence structure is substandard ,0
sonder.vision, i like the idea of creating an api to connect the blockchain to e commerce sites ,1
sonder.vision, they then explain how the transaction will be anonymous and the website will not be able to tell who made the purchase ,1
sonder.vision, i could see how this could be helpful for dark web purchases however for normal everyday purchases if there is a problem with the order if a refund is necessary warranties etc this system does not appear to be fit to handle it ,0
decoin.me,where is your whitepaper all the links are broken ,0
biotron.io,where is your deposit? ite didn't started yet ,0
adsigma.io,where is your company registered? could i have a copy of certificate of incorporation list of directors and details of registered office address?,0
bitforex.com,where is the team that is laid out in the pitch? four page whitepaper is just not going to cut it guys you will have to put in a bit more effort than that to raise 10 20 million euro in eth with the 100 million yuan you raised you ought to spend some resources on making a better presentation here which includes all the luminaries you brag about and has a decent whitepaper ,0
bitforex.com, i also used the product and found it cumbersome and complicated in chinese ,0
vanig.io,where is the mvp? you're seeking to raise a hard cap of $20m with no product available to see? ,0
vanig.io, why? the idea is fine ,1
vanig.io, but this is hardly the first company to try and solve this problem with blockchain and with this idea ,0
vanig.io, the difference being that the team behind them has more e commerce experience and have actual real working products ,1
www.bitorb.com,where is the mvp? the link here is dead ,0
www.bitorb.com, why should i request whitepaper to read? the whitepaper should be open to everyone ,0
www.bitorb.com, here i see old fashioned fundraising attempt to make ico with very negligent approach ,0
www.bitorb.com, why the hardcap exceeds the softcap 20 times? what about analysis of competitors in such competitive area as exchanges?,0
www.corexcoin.io,where is the marketing program or bounty program ?? regards,0
www.multiversum.io,where is the long term plan? deliverables ,0
www.multiversum.io, nice idea ,1
www.multiversum.io, but nor quite there ,0
rentberry.cryptonomos.com,where does it say us citizens will not be able to participate? i see no restrictions listed,0
giftz.io,where are you headquartered? many investors prefer companies located in san francisco/silicon valley or new york 
kript.io,when you plan to list coin on public exchange for trading?,0
www.depository.network,when you make a new business you enter a competition with other icos or fiat projects that provide various solutions to satisfy the tagreted customers so it is a mistake not no make a competitive analysis it make believe that your strategy maybe wrong and out of the market ,0
www.depository.network, there is also no business planning in the wp ,0
www.depository.network, the team itself is too localised,0
transcodium.com,when you click on buy and deposit funds through it you get your tokens automatically on your dashboard ,1
medicohealth.io,when we go to the hospital we can not choose a doctor patients don't know the information about the doctor well and the patient commits the life to the unknown person following the philosophy of this project patients have access to more reliable doctors ,1
medicohealth.io, i'm very happy that blockchain technology is used for such critical solutions ,1
envion.org,when the deal with enel is sealed there are no limits for envion!,1
envion.org,it will open a lot of doors for future partnerships ,1
envion.org, but whats more important for me is that a partnership like this one will strenghten confidence in envion from the general public and this is highly valuable in the cryptospace now even more with so many scams being around ,1
stopthefakes.io,when starting a business you’ve got more than a few things on your mind important things that can’t afford to be overlooked ,0
stopthefakes.io, recognising the company mission is important is one of those things that unfortunately can become undone in the beginning ,0
www.aimedis.com,when reviewing the team members and their backgrounds it's apparent that if there's one team to pull off this project it's this team ,1
www.aimedis.com, the vision and product are simple enough ,1
www.aimedis.com, would have liked to seen a lower raise amount and starting valuation but maybe they priced this way because they already have some interested vcs ,1
www.aimedis.com, we'll see what happens but i do wish this project success because the world does need a solution like this ,1
spectivvr.com,when refrel token they provide,0
tachain.io,when rating any ico projects here at icobench what we look at first is it kyc report if it is verified and passed it is good to review ,1
tachain.io, although i love the idea but it makes me feel really concerned about the project which has not conducted the ico kyc report hope this will be conducted and passed soon ,0
tachain.io, advisors are good but team of only two is too thin and frankly i will not invest in the project of two men team ,0
tachain.io, this must be improved very soon ,0
tachain.io, my ratings were adjusted with more information provided by ceo with regards to team vision and mvp ,1
btu-protocol.com,this is the riskiest possible type of investing,0
arciris.info,when indian are going for crypto it's seems fishy to me because in their country crypto currency trading is banned last years many arrests happen ,0
arciris.info, seems team is young ,0
arciris.info, vision: vision is well explained ,1
arciris.info, but i have mentioned that in their country cryptocurrency is completely banned last time their indian digital rupee currency was established in a market because it is only and only currency which is allowed ,0
arciris.info, product: no live product ,0
arciris.info, avoid the project rest is your choice ,0
stream.space,when ico start plz tel me,0
i-chain.net,when i'm trying to check up the demo mvp version by link it's sends me to a subdomain with invalid ssl certificate so i give fair 1 for product ,0
i-chain.net, there is no any team member from blockchain industry and advisors list is empty ,0
i-chain.net, the idea is not bad ,1
i-chain.net,but hardcap in 500k ethers? it fails the approach ,0
jcointoken.info,when i see someone who does not even bother to add pictures or linkedin profiles on the team listing here i think that they will face bigger issues later on ,0
jcointoken.info, the whitepaper looks like a school project ,0
jcointoken.info, you can do better than this guys!,0
twogap.com,when i see a new way to earn from crypto investments lik twogap my gut reaction is how many of these do we need? i'm likely wrong there ,0
twogap.com, the market for investment tools in the future could well be much larger ,1
twogap.com, i prefer to see companies creating something to improve the world give access to those not in the markets now etc ,1
twogap.com, beyond my bias i like the vision here ,1
twogap.com, the team looks to be unproven ,0
twogap.com, i will be excited to be wrong about their ability to make a great product ,1
presale.ventures,when i read about this ico i really intrigued but regards,1
presale.ventures,team: no kyc!!!!! ,0
presale.ventures,since i only check linedin because the team is unknown for me they has advisors known too maybe it is good but i think not ,0
presale.ventures, the site: we seem to see a copy of another known portal in version vc/pre the mechanics clearly are very similar ,0
presale.ventures, the mvp: has a certificate error ,0
presale.ventures, i couldn't test it regards the mechanics declared: it is not clear how the algorithm works if for example similar to our assessment bot and who would be experts who would assess the ico is your team? ,0
cresio.io,when i read about the first legal ico approved in spain by the local regulator cnmv i was interested in finding out more about the project
cresio.io, analyzing it and digging to see what´s behind cnmv gives the green light to cresio ,1
cresio.io, the statement that the ico has been approved by the cnmv is not accurate 
cresio.io, cnmv has stated that they do not consider this project to be subject to financial supervision by the markets authority ,0
cresio.io, the claim made by cresio may confuse some investors as indicating that this project is somehow regulated or approved supervised by the cnmv which is not the case ,0
cresio.io, i highly recommend cresio to be extremely careful with such marketing moves in order to avoid any potential liability eg see the dispute of cnmv with housers as crowdfunding platform for a similar case the project proposes a single platform to control and operate simultaneously in multiple exchanges ,0
cresio.io, the concept may be interesting for heavy duty traders 
cresio.io, but does not offer an interesting value proposition for retail or ordinary crypto asset holders ,0
cresio.io, platform creators explained in bitcointalk that this is not meant for ordinary crypto asset holder but for a limited amount of 5000 people who will be able to use the platform ,1
cresio.io, i remember 10 years ago when several start ups were trying to implement one platform to rule all social networks from the same place the concept did not gain any traction and most of them were abandoned as a complete fail ,0
cresio.io, it may be possible that this project can find its audience in professional crypto traders ,1
cresio.io, how useful and scalable would that be? what about otc operations? ,0
cresio.io,the project has currently a working mvp under development which is a good sign ,1
cresio.io, cresio introduces the idea of wallethold a remuneration system in tokens for the platform users interesting concept which should be analyzed more in detail ,1
cresio.io, project claims that it offers high level security without revealing how this would be accomplished ,0
cresio.io, potential users will be definitely worried about using a platform to control all their wallets from all their exchanges ,0
cresio.io, they will need more in order to deposit their trust ,0
cresio.io, the white paper is introducing the legal aspects headlines in number 10 but totally lacks the legal information and guarantees ,0
cresio.io, this is a pretty serious omission which should be corrected asap ,0
cresio.io, the assembled team may not have sufficient blockchain projects experience apart from one person from mining and another one specialized in airdrops ,0
cresio.io, lack of relevant advisors who may mentor through this process could be also an issue ,0
cresio.io, i would recommend finding advisors who may fit the project profile such as prominent traders ,0
cresio.io, experts are blockchain technology enthusiasts contributing to the community without any remuneration ,1
forest.io,when i learned about forest i immediately got interested ,1
forest.io, a token for doing carbon offsets backed by actual forests? that raises some questions but even though the project is in an early stage the whitepaper is well written ,1
forest.io, although the business/financial parts need some additional work and does an excellent job in describing the why's and what's of the project ,1
forest.io, the team is small but seems legit ,1
forest.io,i have had the opportunity to interact with at least a couple of the team members before reviewing ,1
forest.io, i'm willing to rate high to encourage further work and engagement to make the project a reality ,1
www.assetstream.co,when i got to hear that assetstream have received another high ico rating from cryptototem i came to a conclusion that these guys are here for a better change,1
www.assetstream.co, so unique,1
konstellation.tech,when first watching their video my immediate concern was that they are entering an extremely crowded regulated space however after reviewing their whitepaper i feel as though they a chance of bringing added value to this space ,1
konstellation.tech, team: the team is reassuring as they have a very strong in house team as well as several prominent members on their advisory board ,1
konstellation.tech, vision: the only reason why they are receiving a 4 in this area ,1
konstellation.tech, is due to the fact the i don't find that the product is extremely ambitious ,0
konstellation.tech, i also am not a fan of the brand as it seems to seem off with the market their trying to penetrate ,0
konstellation.tech, this may be a personal opinion but darcmatter seems a little off when trying to represent a brand that stands for decreased fraud malicious intent and increase transparency ,0
konstellation.tech, product: the product itself seems sound however i am not a fan of nem in terms of enterprise scaleability as it does have some fallacies ,0
konstellation.tech, hopefully they'll consider the switch to hyperledger in the future ,0
www.gastroadvisor.com,when choosing a restaurant recently users will refer to the reviews of third parties ,1
www.gastroadvisor.com, however if the number of reviews is small it will be difficult to obtain credit ,0
www.gastroadvisor.com, the problem is the creation of merit for the reviewer ,0
www.gastroadvisor.com, i feel that this project is going to solve this problem well ,1
bankex.com,when blockchain is using within the right industry it leads to great examples of projects ,1
www.rightmesh.io,i think smartmesh has great potential ,1
nucypher.com, this looks good ,1
trueplay.io, i see only the next clone without original idea ,0
www.thetatoken.org,what's fascinating about theta network now than ever before is the underlying sentiment of cdn video networks that are hosted on large data centers are being attacked by regulators for manipulating or at minimum avoiding oversight of video content you only have to watch youtube and see that an audience of disgruntled content providers get booted off the system and/or see limited access of their content to fans of their videos the control held by the largest media companies have tight control of their bandwidth and content network and can deny anyone the availability to post content that doesn't meet their guidelines we've lived with this central bank approach to media networks for 70 years theta networks is allowing the users on the network to govern and offer their available bandwidth to stream content and be rewarded for renting their memory and storage to others in a decentralized media network to stream content ,1
www.thetatoken.org, theta network because its decentralized could very well be a zero to one startup by opting to focus on accelerated markets like esports gaming education and conferencing in many countries at the local level of distribution ,1
www.thetatoken.org, the tfuel token is now available for trade on binance exchange and doubled on their first day of availability ,1
www.thetatoken.org, this token didn't seem to catch the eyes of many because the market was oversaturated with negative icos when they announced however the updated roadmap and the solid team with a silicon valley investment makes this a potential winner as more millennials seek other alternatives to earning in the gig economy and support to an infrastructure of mesh streamers for a new category in media ,1
www.bitdegree.org,what?? bitdegree is udemy or codecademy equivalent and for such reason frankly i don't see bright future in this project as the tech education market is much intense ,0
www.bitdegree.org, the only good thing bitdegree does is those temporary free and high quality courses they offer ,1
heta.org,what they tackle is the global industrial revolution this is the significance of the existence of the block chain ,1
heta.org, a solid road map and a token balance are profound with professional team members ,1
heta.org, partners are also solid global ,1
heta.org, everyone is shallowly trying to solve with erc 20 but this project develops its own project and is trying to accomplish what is necessary for the world and their even more wonderful thing is the ecosystem ,1
heta.org, heta is building an ecosystem accepted all over the world ,1
bithercash.com,what they are saying is very splendid but no one will surely understand it ,0
bithercash.com, they think they should better understand the priorities of what they should do ,0
centive.org,what the team is trying to accomplish is worthwhile around the world ,1
centive.org, but the team is too small to accomplish this i feel that there are too many competing projects ,0
centive.org, since mvp works well this team may be able to accomplish but usp is not clear ,0
centive.org, hard caps are huge ,0
centive.org, i think that a gradual financial plan is necessary ,0
crypt-on.io,what the project is trying to accomplish is huge but by integrating the four services into one platform it will maximize the convenience for users and investors ,1
crypt-on.io, i think that this convenience keyword is very useful for sorting out the most powerful ones among the frequent icos ,1
crypt-on.io, nobody wants to use services that require complicated procedures and work ,0
crypt-on.io, i can mention that the team is international and rich in expertise in various fields ,1
crypt-on.io, inviting the owner of dao to its own platform the business construction of the project is precise ,1
crypt-on.io, many ico projects remain concerned about long term possession but this project shows usefulness for long term possession ,1
www.ethichub.com,what percentage of investment do you anticipate coming from institutional investors? the concern is the whales pump and dump ,0
www.winnest.io,what makes this project stand out is the solid team behind it ,1
www.winnest.io, even though the idea might not be unique ,0
www.winnest.io,i think they might be able to pull it off and have the first working and actually usable social marketplace something that we have been waiting for long ,1
www.winnest.io, would be good to test the mvp as soon as it's available ,1
matrix-coin.io, team and project goes to make crypto usable and reliable on integrating really needful and useful features on it: anonymous transactions extremely low fees for transactions easy for use multi wallet where funds will remain secure and safe ,1
matrix-coin.io, as innovation i see it gonna be run on x11 blockchain combining pow mining and masternodes rewards ,1
matrix-coin.io, we need this project makes happen ,1
matrix-coin.io, looking forward for come this project to realization!,1
www.etherlegends.io, what kills this ico is the lack of scalability,0
www.etherlegends.io, why tie a physical trading card game to smart contracts? another is the target,0
www.etherlegends.io, customer: would young players actually find the benefit of having ether associated tokens to the game? application of tokens is a massive stretch ,0
www.etherlegends.io, i am not a believer ,0
consentium.net,what is unique needs to come out clearer in the usp unique selling point another chat app won't fly ,0
consentium.net, team looks thin for undertaking such a monumental task in such a competitive field ,0
cryptomarketcloud.com, additionally cmc will become a full sto which like any traditionally business the cmc holders and investors is entitled to revenue and voting rights ,0
cryptomarketcloud.com, all the best!,1
onlinegamecoin.com, there are so many currency already out there and each one has it own value ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, this is just another coin and snbl said they will raise the value of the coin which is not possible ,0
ico.kuende.com,what impressed me the most about this ico is the fact that they have a working platform with an earning system that incentivizes users to engage with content on the platform ,1
ico.kuende.com, it is evident that they have put time and money into development and intend on following through on the vision ,1
ico.kuende.com, having said that it is hard to fully grasp the enhanced offline experience that they are promising without seeing it in action there are definitely other player in this space but the biggest factor to determine the success of this project is execution and user adoption if they are able to foster a community of active users in the same way that sites like meetup have been able to identify geo specific groups this can be a successful project ,1
ico.kuende.com, not an original idea by any means but it puts a unique twist on social media ,1
snapparazzi.io,what im concerned is that unnecessarily extreme and persistent information excites the audience with some degenerative thinking as everyone becomes a news publisher and transcends censorship is that in point ,0
snapparazzi.io, whether the video is actually selected or not is a different problem if there is a possibility of getting a reward a person takes a risk and would not it be that more people will get hurt?,0
snapparazzi.io, hard caps are too expensive ,0
snapparazzi.io, there is no mvp it is a mystery whether the team will work ,0
snapparazzi.io, the team announced a cool mvp and proved its ability ,1
www.xgpcoin.com, team try to do all the best for make crypto world much more closer understandable stable and clear to all the people all over the world ,1
www.xgpcoin.com, for sure there is no way to solve all the problems at once but what i see ,0
www.xgpcoin.com, it's hard work and abilities to do something good and valuable ,0
www.xgpcoin.com, i wanna encourage the team and wish good luck on their hard work to be done!,1
eos.io,what i love about eos is how they have not been afraid to compromise some early tech advances pow for the sake of product practicality ,1
eos.io, yes its a distributed os more than a distributed ledger but they embrace this which ultimately means dapps are easy and more efficient to build and run and more likely to succeed in the long run ,1
gpcc.io,what does buying token from the open market means,0
casperproject.io, you can join system as provider of free storage space and get reward in cst ,1
eroiy.io, wenn are in the ico the token doesn't costs 100$ ,0
www.bitdegree.org, have you even looked at the project this token has more use case than 99% of shit that's on the market ,1
www.bitdegree.org, they have a working product and students/teachers/businesses backing them up ,1
www.bitdegree.org, most shitcoins don't even have a working product and their token is literally useless ,0
www.bitdegree.org, with bitdegree you can atleast buy their courses or business services ,1
www.bitdegree.org,i see the problem that is solved ,1
www.bitdegree.org,nevertheless i think there will be more innovative ideas to tackle that problem soon so i don't fully buy in that idea ,0
www.cryptassist.io,what could you possible need almost $40 million for to build essentially an education app and link a few different apis together? even a debit card? you need about $10k upfront to set a debit card program nothing of this is new or original either ,0
www.cryptassist.io, anyone could put together an application in a week that just plugs apis into existing news sources exchanges and education pools debit cards ,0
webcoinico.com,i don't understand it ,0
webcoinico.com,it’s impossible to pay with it for something until the platform is launched ,1
www.hoqu.io, coin is promising because it is backed by an interesting project ill have turnover due to it ,1
www.hoqu.io, this will make the price grow ,1
www.coinstocks.io,what can i say the world needs this! this team is working hard to bring us an ux friendly bug ,0
www.coinstocks.io, free exchange ,1
www.coinstocks.io, i have researched their community 13.5k members great admins they have human ,1
www.coinstocks.io,centric approach from their product to customer support ,1
www.coinstocks.io, i am eager to become their beta tester and to follow their project great stuff ahead for sure ,1
tncoin.io,what a wonderful day to support this project ,1
enkidu.io,what a simple and necessary product! ,1
enkidu.io, only one thing is unclear why do you need softcap $ 5 million and all the more hardcap $ 30 million?, 0
enkidu.io,i think both development and marketing can not cost 30 million dollars here ,0
howdoo.io,what a great project ,1
howdoo.io, with the bad press about fb at the moment this couldn't come at a better time ,1
howdoo.io, long live howdooqqq ,1
www.art-pro.io,what a great idea ,1
www.art-pro.io, this project will increase traceability authenticity and accountability and this makes so much sense on blockchain ,1
www.art-pro.io, manage your strategy well and you could be a winner! some of your biggest competitors have been here for ages but being on blockchain for you could be a game changer ,1
www.art-pro.io, the team: interesting bunches but why you need so many advisors? ,0
www.art-pro.io, i think if you fine tune your team ,1
www.art-pro.io, your board seem to have limited experience,0
www.art-pro.io, you could acquire more talents on board rather than advisors ,0
www.art-pro.io, good luck ahead i wish you success on this exciting project!,1
cotrader.com,what a great idea,1 
cotrader.com, i have been awaiting for such super cool projects on blockchain and finally found one ,1
cotrader.com, this is a great platform for the investors to invest without any worries as this entire platform runs on ethereum there is no need for a second thinking ,1
cotrader.com, the best part is that the platform is already live on both the main and test net which is a key to their success ,1
cotrader.com, this shows that the team is actually doing something and are pretty serious about the project ,1
cotrader.com, this is going to be a game changer in the fund investment industry ,1
cotrader.com, hi team you have my support on this project ,1
cotrader.com, best wishes ,1
www.timebox.network,what a fantastic project ,1

www.timebox.network, good luck guys! you are on to something amazing!,1
wepower.network,wepower good trend!,1
www.setcoin.co.uk,went through their whitepaper and it's not the best of white papers ,0

tge.wemark.com,wemark is building a platform that will empower content creators — without the need of middle men ,1
tge.wemark.com, project has a strong team ,1
tge.wemark.com, however they might be lacking experience in the field they want to tackel ,0
tge.wemark.com, wemark makes up for this with a very good advisory board setting them up for possible success ,1
tge.wemark.com, it remains to be seen whether the project can create enough traction to move the marketplace for digital content to a decentralized blockchain based variant ,0
tge.wemark.com,wemark is building a blockchain based marketplace for digital content and its a decent size market at $4b ,1
tge.wemark.com, however it might be a tough competition going into the market because of the nature of the digital content industry ,0
tge.wemark.com, that said i think the fact that they have already $1m funding in equity financing proves a really strong case that it actually is a legitimate project invested by traditional funds ,1
tge.wemark.com,wemark is a growing community of leading independent photographers licensing their photos directly to customers with no agency involved ,1
tge.wemark.com,wemark has a great concept and and equally good team to execute it ,1
tge.wemark.com, if they can execute it in a proper way they can cut out the middleman in the digital content industry ,1
delta.money,wellwaylife thx for your comment ,1
delta.money, delta paltform: bitcoin and eth very slow and expensive transactions only 10 tx/sec on btc and 50 tx/sec n eth ,0
delta.money, delta it's fast and cheap platform ,1
delta.money, where transactions on own blockchain will be fast and total speed on all blockchains over 1m tx/sec ,1
delta.money, also we will add dags structures analogious iota ,1
www.bitdegree.org,well yes i would agree that bitdegree is similar to udemy's or codeacademy's concept ,1
www.bitdegree.org,but they're trying to implement something really important that the market is lacking of motivational incentives to complete the courses ability to access education for those who cannot afford it and connect employers with skilled tech talents ,1
www.bitdegree.org, from my point of view this project can become a strong competitor for the existing platforms one day ,1
www.hoqu.io,well yep it’s a clear choice ,1
www.hoqu.io,but sometimes it isn’t easy to do it ,0
www.silkchain.io,well written wp an ambitious project with a great vision ,1

www.silkchain.io, removing or lessening the hurdles and obstacles to cross border trading is always desireable i am a strong advocate of a globalised and transparent international system for trade ,1
www.silkchain.io, if all goes well silkchain might be the gamechanger that the industry has been waiting for ,1
www.silkchain.io, i wish the team a great success and good luck!,1
ico.propify.online,well written and presented white paper ,1
ico.propify.online, they have been working on the project for a while ,1
ico.propify.online, functionally this finished product will most likely be a better property finding solution than existing options like zillow ,1
ico.propify.online, but i don't see a clear cut niche that gives a significant enough competitive advantage to incentivize the market to choose this option over the competition ,0
www.timebox.network,well whit this advisor and this team ,1
www.timebox.network, best of luck then ,1
www.glutoken.com,well thought out with substantial existing code base ,1
www.glutoken.com, user adoption is key to success for glu ,0

cryptonod.com, no team no whitepaper half the allocation stays with team typos galore ,0
cryptonod.com, ouch ,0
digitaldegree.io,well this looks like a interesting project ,1
www.deepaero.com,well the claim is huge but about section discusses generic things and tells little information about how deep aero is going to achieve and coordinate efforts ,0
www.deepaero.com, whitepaper starts with what are drones seriously guys? if people are investing in your project they should know what a drone is what's your target audience? kids from kindergarten? ,0
www.deepaero.com, whitepaper has more images than text i believe that for projects like this an existing supplier/manufacturer/distributor has a competitive advantage over a novice team ,0
www.deepaero.com, honestly looks like a scam ,0
xmoneta.com,well that would be great! ,1
xmoneta.com,then the money will go to further stages of development like then we can also open the bank ,1
xmoneta.com, but the smart contract is set up to the hard cap 8000 eth ,0
www.lendo.io,well structured ico goodluck ,1
ico.realcasino.io,well structured and well ,1

ico.realcasino.io, let's see how you can compete ,1
cotrader.com,well structured and balanced team ,1

faceter.io,well researched white paper from the business perspective ,1
faceter.io,but there are technical and implementation questions that i still have ,0
faceter.io, regarding the paragraph in the whitepaper faceter hardware solutions priority is given to close cooperation with suppliers of video surveillance equipment it is also planned to develop proprietary and co branded video cameras capable of performing primary video stream processing and its obfuscation on embedded chips optimized for faceter algorithms ,1
faceter.io, what progress are has been made with the large cctv companies like dahua hikvision and axis to bring this computing power to the edge? what hardware will miners require to process the data high end specialised graphics cards that can process image data on existing pc's in idle time or dedicated and specialised hardware? the proof of recognition protocol is new to me ,0
faceter.io, how many nodes are required to validate a transaction? how are nodes selected? what are the image quality requirements 720p full hd etc ? ,0
faceter.io,the tracking of particular people over different time periods eg the employee or criminal use case : to what do you reconcile your a person data to an actual subject of interest? ,0
faceter.io,this project steps deeply into the personal data privacy space and i don't see any legal specialists on the team ,0
faceter.io, these issues need to be addressed upfront and can t be an afterthought with different data privacy regulations in different jurisdictions ,0
www.presearch.io,well positioned to be very successful and really needed for decentralised web searches ,1
www.presearch.io, some of the data here on icobench is not up to date ,0
www.presearch.io, so i relied on the website for the most accurate and timely info ,1
www.presearch.io, for example the team members on the web site has more members ,1
www.presearch.io, overall great project and potential ,1
test.ton.org,well obviously it hasn't stopped him from bringing in $850million in the first private round ,1

data.eco, in fact i bought this ico ,1
diwtoken.com,well needed idea clear vision led by a good team ,1
www.stopthefakes.io,well knowing and showing that there is some intellectual property rights violation does not mean anything ,0
www.stopthefakes.io, it will not let the ip owners return possible return commercial losses ,0
www.stopthefakes.io, the project does not solve any key problem there ,0
borser.cr,well its nothing about selling of shares of the company where founders profiles cant be verified kyc missing and not sufficient info to judge what their plan is ,0
borser.cr, this def does not feel like a good option to consider ,0

coincasso.io,i am fine with the team they seem like good people from poland they have no bad history but also they have no history at all at least online or at least something noticeable about delivering projects and what about their experience for example ,0
coincasso.io, i love the project,1
coincasso.io, but i am not convinced in investing a single dime in it as many questions are left unanswered ,0
coincasso.io, i have done a study about hybrid exchanges like tokenjar and others they cost nothing couple of thousands as they do not need any major security protection or any hard coding as people tend to keep their coins in their own wallets like metamask and so on ,0
coincasso.io, until now i would stay away ,0

naviaddress.io, what3words what3words is the innovative company with a great product ,1
naviaddress.io, this company was the first in the market that started to solve accumulated issues that conventional addressing systems had been unable to solve for the last 20 years ,1
naviaddress.io, but you cannot directly compare what3words and naviaddress ,1
naviaddress.io, what3words is to greater extent is a uniform and consistent geolocation grid system that delivers greater value in quickly finding desired location ,1
naviaddress.io, naviaddress is a unified digital addressing system assigning digital id to any place and object with geo coordinate precision ,1
naviaddress.io, it is being migrated to the blockchain now in order to provide users with ability to create own and share trustless addresses naviaddresses as said these addresses will be verified by transactions with address owners businesswise we are different completely ,1
naviaddress.io, w3w is a proprietary system selling licenses while naviaddress platform is freemium ,1
naviaddress.io, users pay only for short digital address ids 1 5 digits called premium naviaddresses address ids with 6 to 10 digits are free ,1
naviaddress.io, w3w perfectly works likely only for a two dimensional object/building that fits into a square of 3x3 m ,1
naviaddress.io, but you will still have an issue with addressing larger buildings and on how to find the door to deliver a parcel ,0
naviaddress.io, the advantage of w3w system is in the offline feature but this brings a serious limitation a user cannot add metadata for his living location and update it ,0
naviaddress.io, the assignment of 3 words to a square is obvious step forward in simplifying the destination/location communication between humans but the issue is still there in cross cultural communications for expats international tourists and culturally diverse urban communities ,1
naviaddress.io, naviaddress addressing system goes further: 1 
naviaddress.io, our patent pending addressing algorithm converts any language existing postal address into a string of digits that are easier to communicate in cross cultural communications ,1
naviaddress.io, example: you want to take a taxi to an office located at archiepiskopou makariou iii 45 larnaka 6017 cyprus you can try pronouncing or spelling it out in greek which would be λεωφόρος αρχιεπισκόπου μακαρείου γ΄ 45 λάρνακα 6017 κύπρος although you'll most likely do it incorrectly but imagine being able to simply say the numbers 357 456017 that's all you would have to do to get to that precise location quickly users have the option of going through the naviaddress mobile or web app or simply google naviaddress 357 456017 any user can create as much naviaddresses as he/she wants and customize them according to particular needs a naviaddress combines 5 things in one an object/location its embedded geo coordinates address description a lot of different metadata also very useful for last mile navigation and a link searchable on internet the system provides with the ability to: a 
naviaddress.io, create big number of addresses within 3x3 m square suitable for multistory buildings assign address to any small object a tree in a park make your address private or public by one click ,1
naviaddress.io, we are change the way how people get and change an address of their physical location ,1
naviaddress.io, we used to first build and/or move in our home and then get the address naviaddress provides a user with the ability to choose the digital address id first and then assign it to his/her living location you can move to another house but your naviaddress stays the same ,1
coinve.st,we have not offered or open any kyc process ,0
povcoin.io,we have no dividends ,0
povcoin.io, it is only possible to earn our povcoin for activity on the website and in the application or buy now and sell our tokens later,1
ico.kickcity.io,we have hard cap $125 mln min investment for contributors $50,0
hicky.io,we have all seem the attention and traction that apps like tinder have received ,1
hicky.io, the online dating industry is not going to slow down anytime soon ,1

alt.estate,we have a strong development team ,1
alt.estate, moreover alex pertsev is on our advisory board ,1
alt.estate, alexey was tech lead in the security audit of many blockchain projects including: dao casino poa network cindicator and allabout me ,1
blockfood.io,we had a first pre sale which we couldn't complete ,0
blockfood.io, we explained the reason here in consequence the planning and execution of the token sale are currently being reworked ,0
lookrev.com,we get up in the morning and do the best we can every day to bring lookrev and its benefits to this world knowing that we have people like you support us! thanks for your support!,1
www.brikcoin.net,we figured this out don't want people to think its still pending ,1
www.brikcoin.net, we don't check this site that often ,0
axt.io,we fancy ourselves as normal too = thank you for checking us out neil!
xtribe.io,we expect more from a project that claims it will disrupt the e commerce industry,0
xtribe.io, no linkedin profiles available ,0
xtribe.io, this is a big and fat red flag ,0
xtribe.io, the project though looks nice it seems to be at the right ballpark ,1
xtribe.io, nothing disruptive though ,1
xtribe.io, soft cap i think is reasonable hard cap is not ,0
xtribe.io, members need to do a lot of work to justify the funding that they are asking ,0
multiversum.io,we don't suggest any specific wallet all the erc20 compatible ones are fine!,1
opencollectors.network,we don't have that in plan at the moment but it something comes up we will let you know,1
ethorse.com,we don't actually know anything about the team other than by observing what they have done that is because they have chosen to remain anonymous since obviously this app could have legal and personal safety consequences for them if they publicly own it so based on that i'm giving 4 since i'd say what they have built is definitely above average and the devs are doing all the right things with website whitepaper source on github active communities and already having an app up and running on the eth testnet ,1
ethorse.com, vision i'll give 4 since although it's a relatively simple idea i think they are being very gutsy tackling this contentious area that will surely ruffle feathers all round the world ,1
ethorse.com, gambling empires across the world should be taking note ,1
ethorse.com, this will certainly not be the last race horse in town to challenge their greedy empires ,1
ethorse.com, i think this app may also provide an interesting channel for prediction markets to get info ,1
ethorse.com, i'm sure there will be insiders who cannot resist making a bet on ethorse to profit from their knowledge ,1
ethorse.com, market analysts take note! product i think is definitely way above average ,1
ethorse.com, pretty much as good as you can get without having a launched product ,1
ethorse.com, as i have mentioned on code test app community they are rating highly ,1
ethorse.com, my only concern on product is if the use of oracalize for determining price is a weakness ,0
ethorse.com, can a single source of price be gamed in some way? maybe a dns hack of their source api causes a huge payout thus placing a huge bounty on anyone who can do such a hack compare to wagerr who will have up to 2000 validators independently publishing sporting event results and then forming consensus ,1
ethorse.com, well the economics of this coin for investors beyond the 100% bonus in round 1 are that you'll get a proportional share of the 5% house take on each bet ,1
ethorse.com, there will be 100m tokens in the public sale 125m total ,0
ethorse.com,if you put in 1eth and get 20000 tokens in the round 1 public sale that means you have a 0.016 percent stake of the take if you assume there are $1m worth of bets per day then that's $50k take for the house leaving you with $8 per day over a year of such volume your 1 eth investment will net you earnings of $2920 at eth/usd=1000 today that's a nice return even ignoring the appreciation of your ethorse tokens that might occur with predictable earnings like that everyone will want to buy in driving the price of the horse token up considerably as volumes on ethorse increase so will the price compare to bond market prices relating to the interest they earn can ethorse get $1m of bets per day? well for comparison just look at coinmarketcap data and you'll see there are 450 coins/tokens each with over $1m volume today over the last 24 hours the combined market volume was worth $46 billion 
ethorse.com, as we know the cryptocurrency markets are highly speculative many people are essentially betting on them ,1
ethorse.com, it seems reasonable that people will be making similar bets as literally bets on ethorse they even use it as a hedging mechanism so even if we imagined only 1/1000th of that total $46b daily volume moving to betting on ethorse that is actually more like tens of millions per day not just a million 
ethorse.com," can you imagine the price of a horse if there was even $10m per day? at the ico public sale 1 price they are selling for about $0.05 each "
ethorse.com, 1eth=$1000 and 20000 horse as i calculated above 1eth worth would net you $2920 per year per $1m of daily betting volume so at $10m daily volume we are talking $29200 per year i would say that easily means 1 horse is worth 29200/20000 or $1.46 more realistically i think people seeing it as a predictable income would actually price it at multiples of that since at that price you're getting at 100% return after one year people would kill for such a guaranteed return elsewhere even at $1m daily volume you're still talking a price of $0.146 or multiples thereof so i reckon this will quickly give a 10x to 100x return for early investors at $100k daily volume that is still $0.0146 earnings per horse per year or 29% of the initial price i wonder if the creators have ever wondered about using ethorse to bet on the price of horse itself? that is pretty meta but i guess might have a destabilizing effect on horse pricing only time will tell i guess as ever only invest as much as you can afford to lose! ps ,1
ethorse.com, this ico stage 1 sold 90% of the hardcap in the whitelist stage and the remainder sold out in seconds in the public stage ,1
digitalticks.com,we do not have a concept of sharing dividend,0
thedealcoin.com,we do not control the rating but we are actively focused on delivering one of the most compliant and quality ico's ever seen in the world ,1
thedealcoin.com, we believe in our project and the team we have assembled are of the highest skillsets in the world and will 100% deliver our business plan through to successful launch,1
assetbase.io,we did not sign up for this service or having an ico at this time ,0
assetbase.io, remove this listing!! icoholder 
assetbase.io, com is just grabbing information off the website and publishing false information ,0
assetbase.io, this is very offensive ,0
assetbase.io, our legal council has been informed assetbase cp,0
coinve.st,we currently have 13000 people registered for our crowdsale with an average of $6k of investment interest per person given this demand we expected the crowdsale to reach its max cap very quickly ,1
blockstack.org,we check many criteria terms discounts prototypes market size etc,1
nauticus.io,we certainly need better and more adapt exchanges out there ,1
nauticus.io, i like the fact that they are building the technology and have financing to build it ,1
nauticus.io, adding mining and other services might be a little bit over ambitious ,0
nauticus.io, technology implementation is a risk ,0
sapien.network,we cannot legally comment on exchanges at this time ,0
bitwoex.com,we cannot access to their social links ,0
bitwoex.com, it is important to know who they are since this is a major element if we can trust them or not ,0
bitwoex.com, on white paper there is no mention about technical matter at all ,0
bitwoex.com, we never know how they achieve their vision ,0
covalentcoin.io,we can't rate 02 like benchy it's why my rate is 1/1/1 ico profil is 01 and i understant why ,0
covalentcoin.io, nothing good in this ico no wp no ws no mvp no kyc no no no ,0
www.cryptoaddo.com,we can't rate 0 like it's why my rate is 1/1/1 ico profil is 07 like benchy and i understant why ,0

coincasso.io,we can not say that the project is exclusive neither innovative as it is trying to land in an already full area of ​​similar projects already full of competitors launched some of which are very rich influential powerful and which already work really well and have found success,0
coincasso.io,but this does not mean that they have no chance of success as there can be room for everyone on the market but it takes more than an idea a whitepaper and a promise 90% of the projects coming from estonia or eeastern europe are exchange or something similar there is a very high turnout in that area ,1
coincasso.io, the team presents various figures apparently well distributed but i could not identify any blockchain developer while the advisors are completely missing ,1
coincasso.io, it is clear that are not the advisors who develop a project but they can help to acquire the necessary qualitative leap since many of them have been in blockchain for several years and have toured for dozens of international conferences gaining experience and knowledge in every side of the sector ,1
coincasso.io, however they seem quite committed in the project and certainly work there also participating in some international conference like the last one in hong kong ,1
coincasso.io, the social media and communication channels have very little community although the team is active and publishes news and updates constantly maybe ,1
coincasso.io,you should look for some other way to encourage the adoption and support of the project since its initial stages ,0
coincasso.io, website well done contains the right information and offers a good preview ,1
coincasso.io, not exactly the same whitepaper which appears to be quite synthetic a long promise a couple of solutions and small strokes of tokenomics and business plans there are no well ,0
coincasso.io, defined value propositions neither analysis of the market or of the various competitors ,0
coincasso.io, the distribution presents a 77% of tokens to the sale which could be a little excessive and a 20% reserve fund which is good as a reserve and in the whitepaper it is specified that they will be blocked for at least 3 years ,1
coincasso.io, they want to distort the system giving users the opportunity to gain money together with the company and in this way that they also have a certain power inside but to do this the project should be an open source and totally distributed maybe implement its own blockchain implement a pos proof of stake where to create a dao and give power even in the hands of the top token holders but all this at the moment it is not ,0
coincasso.io, they are looking for a development in ethereum like 99% of exchanges so the only decentralized thing will be the payment system everything else remains centralized ,0
coincasso.io, on github there are no traces of works or updates it is completely empty ,0
coincasso.io, the mvp is a very normal and does not present any revolutionary or innovative features but simply a preview of the wallet of the various coins it can contain and a graph implemented by tradingview ,0
coincasso.io, there is also a huge chasm between the softcap 3.5m and the hardcap 100m if you need 100m to execute the project what would you do with only 3.5m? surely it is still too early to give a 100% accurate assessment and certainly the crypto / ico market is not passing the best of moments but we will see what the progress will be in the coming months ,0
coincasso.io, good luck with crowdfunding ,1
www.canlead.io,we can detect a slight lack of experiences in the blockchain / ico sector from the core team ,0
www.canlead.io, a few advisors should fill this weakness ,0
www.canlead.io, weak community so far ,0
www.canlead.io, i particularly appreciate the referral aspect of the project but i doubt that this will be enough to attract the entire professional community 
www.canlead.io, many of them i think will not find it very interesting to exchange their precious time for perhaps a few hundred euros 
www.canlead.io, the integration of a professional social network could in my opinion reverse this trend 
www.canlead.io, especially when you see the more than limited functionality of our dear linkedin 
www.canlead.io, mvp already available and this is a very good point that few icos have 
www.canlead.io, job offer available and seems operational 
www.canlead.io, i would be happy to increase these scores against good arguments 
www.canlead.io, good luck to the team 
elrond.com,we can definitely bet on elrond to be one of the most interesting projects this season ,1
elrond.com, the team despite not consisting of c level executives from international corporations has something that is much more important: blockchain industry expertise,1
elrond.com, these people are real they work every day together in the office and they are doing it for a bigger amount of time than some of the already tradable projects that have not delivered anything despite raising millions ,1
elrond.com, elrond did not open any funding rounds until they had concept validated and tested which one and a half year of self funded development ,1
coinve.st,we are working with a large card issuer so the experience would be similar to using any debit card today ,1

kin.kik.com, but they will 100% have usability ,1
bankera.com,we are seeing good symbiosis of fintech/ico project ,1
bankera.com, the team as we can see has already useful experience from spectrocoin which mean at least knowledge of what they are doing ,1
bankera.com, still it is one of the hottest potatoes in this sector competing the traditional banks! insufficient information on wp for finances ,1
bankera.com, big numbers/cost for wages 200 employees in 1st year really strange to not see the ceo and cto advocating for their own project on some social network at least having their positions listed there,0

www.vectorium.co, although x13 is an algorithm that received great attention in japan a year or so ago it made the general minor unfair i hope that their groundbreaking effort will wipe out this concern ,1
hicky.io,was brought here by aggressive and pointless marketing in messaging apps,0
hicky.io,consequently took a look at the product ,1
hicky.io, long story short: tons of pure common bs wording in the white paper yeah a lot have been read so reprints quotes and rephrases were noticed in every second paragraph ,0
hicky.io, also i failed to locate any substantial projected financials in the whitepaper which is a crucial flaw for the dating app* since that market is one of the most competitive out there ,0
hicky.io, it really feels like a clear case of [ab]using blockchain with little to no reason just to get that buzzword for ico ,0
hicky.io, with all due respect to the blockchain decentralized development hicky claims only their app and according user data has any foreseeable moneymaking potential so let's call things for what they are ,1
mobilink.io,if icoholder received any type of a complaint it was do to the investigation against shehar yar a former dev for mobilink coin who is defending a real fraud investigation into blocksims just google blocksims fraud ,1

ico.rentberry.com, they already raised 4million ,1
ico.rentberry.com, what did they do with that money ,0

bedcoin.global,vlad ceo of bedcoin was agent who purchased 2 rooms for renting on airbnb he thought that business is not going good so he came to crypto world he spent 1 day to create 2 pages of articles with bunch of waste ideas called white paper and projected such way that he will take over airbnb 
bedcoin.global, but uses know everything and he failed to raised more than 3 eth in ieo he failed to scam people ,0
bedcoin.global, now days crypto world is smart enough to understand reality ,1
bedcoin.global, bedcoin is totally scam project ,0
www.vite.world,vite is the tinder for events ,1
www.vite.world, great tagline but is it needed? team is lacking experience and i am unsure on whether the team works for bitdreams or for vite? as bitdreams is just a company focusing on initial coin offering ico token creation marketing and branding business development and capital fundraising ,0
www.vite.world, the founders of this site are listed as team members of vite additionally the advisory board are also just people that are mentioned on bitdreams site and i cannot find any information on whether they are really endorsing vite ,0
www.vite.world, lastly the company working with vite have vitalik buterin mentioned in the board of advisors seems really doubtful to me ,0
www.vite.world, there is no telegram channel and the one mentioned just links to bitdreams and a welcome bot with zero interaction ,0
www.vite.world, additionally the reddit links to 1 single post and their bitcointalk contains nothing but the standard good project i'm in posts ,0
www.vite.world, the first facebook post is from september 2017 however the ico is just now? roadmap is almost non existend and providing zero details additionally there is almost no useful information in the whitepaper ,0
www.vite.world, there might come a solution for event creating promotion and ticket sales using the blockchain ,1
www.vite.world, but i don't think this project will be it ,0
www.vite.world, there is an app called vite exclusive events it has 100 downloads and it was last updated in october 2017 ,0
www.vite.world, i have not downloaded this to check it out but i do not expect much from it ,0
www.vite.world, the project might be legit but i am not getting the feel it is or at least that it needs the blockchain ,0
www.vite.world, thinking vite is just trying to lift off the crypto hype please stay wary ,0
www.lifevita.io,vita is a promising project with a promising vision ,1
www.lifevita.io, they have an original vision and i believe they will be the pioneers of blockchain mortgage ,1
www.lifevita.io, another good thing is that they are being licensed in the uk ,1
www.lifevita.io, i must admit that this project has given me mixed feelings over the past week as i have received mixed information regarding it after i have provided my first rating ,0
www.lifevita.io, i have contacted all parties via linkedin and it seems that it has been a misunderstanding ,1
algebraixdata.com,visiting algebraixdata com for a copy of all the company documents relating to this project,1
fiii.io,visited and see that the number of installs is 1000+ and not as per above stated over 350000 registered users something is amiss serious red flag!,0
aco.ai,visions needs to be work upon ,0
aco.ai, as said there is difference between crowdfunding and crowdfinancing please improve upon pitching ,0
aco.ai, project looks good ,1
enkidu.io,vision/ product: dao development is a hot frontrunner really like how actual personal use cases spawned the business ,1
enkidu.io, great use of blockchain/smartcontracts ,1
enkidu.io, innovation aspects and opportunity to develop intellectual property is high ,1
enkidu.io, facets to explore: may take the market a long time to catch up customer acquisition costs due to process retooling may be very high ,0
enkidu.io, team: seems like a very intelligent team ,1
enkidu.io, surrounded themselves with a great team of advisors facets to explore: ceo seems to have multiple ventures may be a concern for focus,0
cotrader.com,vision: though not novel or ground breaking the vision is good with excellent projections shown at the end of the white paper ,1
cotrader.com, the blockchain should bring advantages to this use case for example transparency 4/5 ,0
cotrader.com, team: an extensive and strong team though some of the 'core' members have not updated their linkedin profiles 4/5 ,1
cotrader.com, product: good to see there is a working mvp before the pre ico stage ,1
cotrader.com, i will watch how this develops with interest 4/5 ,1
www.b2bx.pro,vision: this is hardly a groundbreaking idea but it is absolutely critical to the future well functioning of digital asset markets ,1
www.b2bx.pro, the challenge is to get it right before the traditional market makers step in 4/5,1
www.b2bx.pro, team: looks strong enough to execute and thankfully does not seem to be underweight in pure capital markets experience 4/5,1
www.b2bx.pro, product: good enough at this stage 4/5,1
www.b2bx.pro, this is not an invitation to invest ,1
www.unboxed.network,vision: this is an interesting vision with structure and potential ,1
www.unboxed.network, i note that there are many global brands involved with the project 4/5 ,1
www.unboxed.network, team: an extensive team with the appropriate skill set for this project ,1
www.unboxed.network, however some members need to update their linkedin profiles 3/5,0
www.unboxed.network, product: the white paper is acceptable and the website is clear and easy to navigate 3/5,1
www.unboxed.network, guys: as ever please feel free to get reach out if you feel i have missed anything critical ,1
www.emmares.io,vision: this is an interesting idea and fairly unusual use case ,1
www.emmares.io, however i am unsure where the connection to the blockchain comes in apart from the idea that email evaluators receive tokens 3/5 ,0
www.emmares.io, team: an extensive team mainly based in slovenia ,1
www.emmares.io, however some members need to update their linkedin profiles as they appear to be spread across other projects 3/5 ,0
www.emmares.io, product: the white paper is acceptable but it may be good to see more information on how the project will be marketed ,1
www.emmares.io, also there is no mvp available to test out 3/5 ,0
www.emmares.io, guys: as ever please feel free to get reach out if you feel i have missed anything critical ,1
one.game,vision: this is an interesting idea although by no means unique ,1
one.game, there is a clear use case for the blockchain here and there is potential for growth ,1
one.game, however it may be difficult to compete in such a market as i suspect there will be many rushing into this space 3/5,0
one.game, team: a fairly small team but strong in the sense that they have relevant experience in software development ,1
one.game, however some of the team members appear to be spread across other projects on linkedin ,0
one.game, a fairly small yet strong team of adivsors 3/5 ,1
one.game, product: the white paper is acceptable but the mpv is weak for this stage of the ico ,0
bolttcoin.io,vision: this is an amusing idea with an ambitious vision ,1
bolttcoin.io, the sector has high demand and the reward based system has potential ,1
bolttcoin.io, bolttcoin already has partnerships with some big company names and there is potential to span across a number of markets ,1
bolttcoin.io, it is also good to see multiple revenue streams 4/5 ,1
bolttcoin.io, team: an extensive team with previous experience in this industry which is reassuring ,1
bolttcoin.io, however many of the team members need to update their linkedin profiles as bolttcoin is not listed within their experience ,0
bolttcoin.io, some team members also have very few connections on linkedin ,0
bolttcoin.io, one member has zero connections ,0
bolttcoin.io, the team lacks in blockchain knowledge but the advisors appear to make up for this ,1
bolttcoin.io, it is also good to see that the team is primarily based in india 3/5,1
bolttcoin.io, product: the white paper is very informative which is always good to see ,1
bolttcoin.io, however the mpv appears to be unavailable with access to a github link only 4/5,0
bolttcoin.io, guys: as ever please feel free to reach out if you feel i have missed anything critical ,1
ico.bailsman.co,vision: this is a very interesting idea ,1
ico.bailsman.co, it's not new in traditional capital markets ,0
ico.bailsman.co, many have attempted to securitise ie create a financial security out of third party guarantees ot other collateral but this is the first time i have seen a blockchain application ,1
ico.bailsman.co, it should be noted that doing this almost certainly creates a financial instrument which might lead to a variety of regulatory issues not only in terms of issuing the security but also in selling or brokering it ,0
ico.bailsman.co, furthermore there may be problems with enforceability 4/5, 1
ico.bailsman.co, team: the team looks strong enough to deliver but some of them need to update their linkedin profiles 4/5 ,1
ico.bailsman.co, profile: i have scored the product mid marks although i have not been able to review it yet ,0
smartstartuptoken.tech,vision: this is a very interesting idea and one with which i fully concur 
smartstartuptoken.tech, it's not exactly unique though that is a strategic rather than a vision problem and somebody at some stage is going to get this right 
smartstartuptoken.tech, i'm deducting marks only because at this stage it seems to be so high level 
smartstartuptoken.tech, guys once the idea is properly fleshed out i would expect to upgrade this to full marks 
smartstartuptoken.tech, 3/5 for now 
smartstartuptoken.tech, team: simon krystman the founder has a solid track record in execution and there are a number of other experienced executives who appear to be on board 
smartstartuptoken.tech, i say appear because there doesn't seem to be a lot of corroboration from linkedin but one imagines this is because again the venture is at a relatively early stage 
smartstartuptoken.tech, i also note that the team is fairly uk centric 
smartstartuptoken.tech, not necessarily a problem but one hopes that proper advice has been taken regarding the domicile of the token issuing entity 
smartstartuptoken.tech, 3/5 for now 
smartstartuptoken.tech, product: at the stage there isn't one so far as i can tell 
smartstartuptoken.tech, my habit in these reviews has become to score a venture with no mvp mid 
smartstartuptoken.tech, marks on the grounds that especially at such an early stage the tech is only part of the product 
smartstartuptoken.tech, 3/5 
smartstartuptoken.tech, summary: overall i'm giving low marks for what could be an excellent idea and an excellent team 
smartstartuptoken.tech, guys 
smartstartuptoken.tech, i would be delighted to review and revise up as soon as you are ready to draw back the curtain 
smartstartuptoken.tech, this is not an invitation to invest 
smartstartuptoken.tech, icos are risky and you can lose everything you put in 
breweryconsortium.com,vision: the vision of making investors into partners in riding the wave of the rapidly expanding craft beer market by means of a token whose value is linked to consumption of brewery consortium beer is interesting ,1
breweryconsortium.com, product: the fact that the company already exists and is working at full speed is definitely comforting ,1
breweryconsortium.com, this reassures investors in the viability of the future steps of the project ,1
breweryconsortium.com, team: the team visibly is highly experienced in the brewing industry ,1
breweryconsortium.com, they also passed the kyc which is always reassuring ,1
breweryconsortium.com, nevertheless not a single person in the team seems to have any experience with blockchain technology ,0
breweryconsortium.com, not even the technical and blockchain advisor which is said to be a blockchain enthusiast nor the legal advisor who should be most aware of all the legal issues of dealing with cryptocurrencies ,0
breweryconsortium.com, as an example it is said that beer token can be converted into share holding in beautiful bubble lda subject to conditions ,0
breweryconsortium.com, these ‘conditions’ may have to do with complying with specific regulations and jurisdictions but this is explained nowhere in the whitepaper ,0
dataeum.com,vision: the vision has potential though incentivised crowd labour is not in and of itself new and the blockchain 'use case' relates as much if not more to the method of incentivisation than the data collection ,0
dataeum.com, nevertheless this is certainly how the crowd sourcing will develop 4/5 ,1
dataeum.com, team: strong and accomplished team with a track record which hopefully are capable of executing as well as just being 'names' 4/5 ,1
dataeum.com, product: the product is well thought out and has a sufficient level of detail bearing in mind the stage the project is at 4/5 ,1
www.autobay.io,vision: the vision for this project is good and has a practical use for car buyers globally ,1
www.autobay.io, however the use of blockchain may not necessarily be needed ,0
www.autobay.io, it is unclear what the advantages of using blockchain are ,0
www.autobay.io, the market is also only limited to those customers who are in possession of bitcoin ethereum or autobay tokens 3/5,1
www.autobay.io, team: there is an extensive team that is based in one location however this may be a problem since the company has a global ambition ,0
www.autobay.io, there appears to be a lack of blockchain background within the team but this is probably offset by the knowledge of many of the advisors 3/5,1
www.autobay.io, product: the white paper looks acceptable and presents the finances well ,1
www.autobay.io, however the cost of placing a car on the platform for a seller is still unknown ,0
www.autobay.io, the mvp is at a good stage considering the company is at pre ico stage 4/5 ,1
codexprotocol.com,vision: the idea of a decentralised immutable registry for assets is a classic use case of the blockchain and unlike say identity is unlikely to be implemented by governments ,0
codexprotocol.com, this means that not only is it a strong idea but also it stands a chance of successfully competing as a commercial venture 4/5 ,1
codexprotocol.com, team: strong team and some good advisors ,1
codexprotocol.com, however could possibly do with more blockchain expertise 4/5 ,1
codexprotocol.com, product: mvp is available and the whitepaper is good enough 4/5 ,1
tokensale.kasko2go.com,vision: the focus seems to be on providing safer drivers with cheaper insurance but this is already done without the use of blockchain technology through companies such as aviva ,0
tokensale.kasko2go.com, also it may be difficult to compete with industry giants who are already offering a similar product and could potentially have the funds to take it that step further and provide it through the blockchain 2/5 ,0
tokensale.kasko2go.com, team: an extensive team with appropriate experience ,1
tokensale.kasko2go.com, however many of the core members need to update their linkedin profiles to show that they are working for kasko2go ,0
tokensale.kasko2go.com, some of the team members also appear to be spread across other projects and the team is not based in one location which may create some obstacles 3/5,0
tokensale.kasko2go.com, product: the white paper is acceptable and focuses on the contrasts between traditional insurance companies and kasko2go such as dynamic evaluation of driving conditions accident risk map and fraud detection ,1
tokensale.kasko2go.com, the app is apparently complete and ready for download 4/5 ,1
www.coinanalyst.tech,vision: something we truly need as trader investors and market analysis ,1
www.coinanalyst.tech, product: need to understand better how ai will be used ,0
www.coinanalyst.tech, team: level and expertise aligned to the challenge ,1
token.shipit.me,vision: on the face of it this is an excellent idea based on the sharing economy with clear disruptive capabilities ,1
token.shipit.me, however there are clearly complex issues involved with transporting packages that other reviewers have already raised ,0
token.shipit.me, i am unconvinced that a review and rating systems will effectively limit fraudulent activities and establish a positive reputation 3/5 ,0
token.shipit.me, team: a strong and extensive team that seems to have an appropriate breadth of experience for the project ,1
token.shipit.me, most of the team however do not link shipit on their linkedin accounts so may need to update i am scoring this a 3 until they update ,0
token.shipit.me, 3/5 product: the mvp is working and the utility provided by the tokens seems convincing enough ,1
token.shipit.me, however the system does not seem to be decentralised relying on shipit to transfer the fee and the amount payable for the item to the traveller ,0
token.shipit.me, i am unsure why this requires blockchain 3/5 ,0
www.gigtricks.io,vision: it's not clear what advantages decentralisation really brings to gig ,0
www.gigtricks.io, economy platforms since the centralised ones like odesk seem to work pretty well and have plenty of functionality regarding freelancer verification authentication of work escrow and so on also i think the phrase to end global recession is what marketers would call an 'over claim' 2/5,0
www.gigtricks.io, team: the team is extensive and strong 4/5 ,1
www.gigtricks.io, product: the mvp is acceptable for this stage of the project ,1
www.gigtricks.io,although the amount trying to be raised seems rather high 3/5,0
www.skyfchain.io,vision: it's a thrilling vision to let businesses communicate with robots for deliveries without any logistics provider in the middle using blockchain ,1
www.skyfchain.io, team: looks strong ,1
www.skyfchain.io, what worries me is regulation ,0
www.skyfchain.io, maybe the information is there but i couldn't find it after a quick read through ,0
www.skyfchain.io, the plan is described as expansion of the partner network to the regions without strict regulation of cargo drones flights cis asia africa,0 
www.skyfchain.io, the risk i see here is that those regions do not have strict regulation yet *because* drones are not common ,0
www.skyfchain.io, if you are successful with skyfchain there will be regulation in those countries as well so i don't buy into that plan ,0
www.skyfchain.io, rather than hoping to avoid regulation i would suggest to add a more proactive approach to regulatory compliance to the project plan ,0
www.skyfchain.io, overall: great idea truly disruptive! grab the bull by the horns upfront around regulation and you will have a winner ,1
aerum.com,vision: it is what we need ,1
aerum.com, infrastructure revolution ,1
aerum.com, scalability and operability are a big concern and impacting the adoption product: needs to make it happened especially for the consensus solution ,0
aerum.com, team: great team with the right potential to deploy the solution ,1
switcoin.com,vision: it is unclear what the advantages of this project are over competitors ,0
switcoin.com, the 'about' section of this project has multiple spelling and grammar mistakes and often makes vague statements such as offering advertisement opportunities with a 'response rate of 100%' without any explanation of how this will be achieved hence i am scoring this a 1 1/5 ,0
switcoin.com, team: a small team with only a single advisor ,0
switcoin.com, there also seems to be minimal experience in financial areas 2/5 ,0
switcoin.com, product: there is currently no mvp available and the link for the white paper is not work hence i am scoring this a 1 as this project is 8 days off an ico ,0
www.investaco.in,vision: interesting vision although not unique ,1
www.investaco.in, a lot of people are trying to do this sort of thing ,0
www.investaco.in, i found the video baffling ,0
www.investaco.in, thankfully there are other ways of figuring out what this ico is about 4/5,1
www.investaco.in, team: the team looks not extensive enough and seems to lack all of the skills that will be needed ,0
www.investaco.in, also some of them look like they might be spread between other projects ,0
www.investaco.in, oh and the main guy seems to have a different name on his linkedin profile despite being kyc verified which is a bit odd 3/5,0
www.investaco.in, product: it's very nice to see an actual product the exchange up and running ,1
www.investaco.in, i'm scoring it 4 on the grounds that it's slightly more advanced than i would expect it to be at this stage of the project 4/5,1
dyno.io,vision: interesting vision although niche there may be privacy issues particularly in europe ,0
dyno.io, the ambition to dominate the market is probably strategically correct if it can be achieved ,1
dyno.io, although i am unsure that the blockchain will ensure that medical researchers get the correct type of high quality data that they need 3/5 ,1
dyno.io, team: a large team covering an extensive set of skills though could use more than the two advisors listed to carefully navigate some complex issues 4/5,1
dyno.io, product: the mvp is available and the white paper is particularly clear which is good at this stage 4/5,1
phoneum.io,vision: hardly a new vision and i suspect there will be many rushing into this space mid marks because well there's nothing wrong with it but to score higher i would need to see more market research and an analysis of market positioning and how such a position might be defended 3/3 ,1
phoneum.io, team: the team looks suitable strong from a technical point of view ,1
phoneum.io,but is probably light on individuals who can take charge of developing and implementing a go to market strategy ,0
phoneum.io, it's a localised team but for software that is not particularly a drawback 3/3,1
phoneum.io, product: it seems that there is an android beta and although i can't test that i run ios i can see no evidence of major complaint under the circumstances it seems appropriate to give 1 ,0
phoneum.io,over mid marks 4/5,1
www.gath3r.io,vision: good project goal to protect users from malware miners getting earning with cpu advertising and more ,1
www.gath3r.io, product : good features 3page wp could have been more visual and more clear for those who are not expert they also are investors ,1
www.gath3r.io, a good solution for both website owners and users to get earning and increase traffic website ,1
www.gath3r.io, mvp is released and working with more than 50000 websites that is a good sign ,1
www.gath3r.io, a such project deserves more ,1
www.gath3r.io, scalability will be a concern with erc20 ,0
www.gath3r.io,but i assume this will be part of the improvement like all the projects based on this technology ,1
www.gath3r.io, team: need to clarify the skills and experience for blockchain and security related to malware attack even if this is already operational ,0
stattm.com,vision: fairly typical blockchain usage with added functionality to users ,1
stattm.com, the additional functionality is offers clear advantages though i expect fierce competition from other businesses 3/5 ,1
stattm.com, team: an average sized team that seems to have particularly strong experience in financial matters according to linkedin profiles there seems to be only one member with significant blockchain and development experience for this project it would be good to see other developers ,0
stattm.com, the team currently lacks any advisors hence i am scoring the team below average marks 2/5,0
stattm.com, product: there is currently no mvp available to check ,0
stattm.com, there is a white paper which provides details on the systems that will be implemented however there is no technical breakdown on how this will achieved or any information on the tokenomics given that the ico starts in 22 days the white paper seems to be lacking currently 2/5,0
www.avinoc.com,vision: excellent vision and a sensible application of the technology ,1
www.avinoc.com, the aviation sector is ripe for a number of blockchain disruptions 4/5,1
www.avinoc.com, team: solid team which look they are capable of delivering although they may be slightly light in some blockchain areas 4/5,1
www.avinoc.com, product: whitepaper seems complete enough and the product in the widest sense seems appropriately developed given the stage of the product 4/5 ,1
www.timebox.network,vision: digital asset custody and related fiduciary services are a huge topic that is a classic ‘genuine’ case for the blockchain ,1
www.timebox.network, however decentralising the index and/or storage doesn’t necessarily solve all of the problems as there are a number of fiduciary issues that remain ,0
www.timebox.network, also it’s not clear how the ico would respond if one of the existing leading cloud digital asset providers google apple microsoft etc were to offer a similar product 4/5,0
www.timebox.network, team: the team is on the face of its strong though nobody seems to have updated their linkedin profiles 4/5,1
www.timebox.network, product: i can’t find evidence of a strong product at this stage 3/5,0
www.nextpakk.com,vision: an interesting use case for the blockchain ,1
www.nextpakk.com, the project has potential but would need to create a strong customer base as there will be tough competition from existing companies who already operate in this industry 4/5,1
www.nextpakk.com, team: the team is fairly small and some of the members need to update their linkedin profiles ,0
www.nextpakk.com, also some members appear to be spread across other projects ,0
www.nextpakk.com, the advisory board looks strong ,1
www.nextpakk.com, kyc verification is noted 3/5,1
www.nextpakk.com, product: the white paper is acceptable although there could be some more detailed analysis on how the project is intended to be marketed ,0
www.nextpakk.com, the mvp is available and easy to navigate 4/5 ,1
www.depository.network,vision: an interesting and ambitions vision though a great deal of experience and work will be needed to be able to deliver this in practice and there may be regulatory and legal issues that need to be considered carefully 3/5,0
www.depository.network, team: the team looks strong although concentrated in bulgaria which maybe an issue given the cross border vision ,0
www.depository.network, some members seem to be shared with other projects 4/5 ,0
www.depository.network, product: the white paper seems to be perfectly acceptable ,1
www.depository.network, it makes clear what problems are being solved and how this might be achieved ,1
www.depository.network, after contact from the team i was able to review the mvp which looks good and better than average for this stage of the project my original rating contained the words the mvp link does not seem to work guys feel free to reach out which are now obviously retracted ,1
www.depository.network, i'm increasing the mark by 1 to 4/5+++,1
ico.kuende.com,vision: an idea that is not unique and will certainly face large competition from other companies ,0
ico.kuende.com, i am unconvinced that a blockchain solution which requires users to manage a virtual token will incentivise people to socialise more offline ,0
ico.kuende.com, other concerns include current industry leaders that develop this utility will have considerable advantages 2/5 ,0
ico.kuende.com, team: a strong and experienced team that includes developers and multiple specialists 4/5,1
ico.kuende.com, product: the white paper is very clear on the process ,1
ico.kuende.com,though the sections for voting for a challenge seem particularly binary where i believe that a degree of flexibility is required when planning challenges ,0
ico.kuende.com, it is encoruaging to see an mvp though the real test will be acquiring a strong network 3/5 ,1
tge.wemark.com,vision: acceptable blockchain use case although by no means unique ,1
tge.wemark.com, established players have a lot of control in this market and may represent tough competition ,0
tge.wemark.com, however already having $1m in equity financing is good to see 3/5,1
tge.wemark.com, team: good team although possibly lacking in crypto experience ,0
tge.wemark.com, an extensive list of advisors seems to provide substantial experience in the business and crypto areas ,1
tge.wemark.com, i note that the team is based in one location 4/5 ,1
tge.wemark.com, product: white paper is not clear on financials and provides very few numbers ,0
tge.wemark.com, however it is good to see the that the mvp is available to use 4/5 ,1
www.gameprotocol.io,vision: a strong vision with a clear use case for the blockchain ,1
www.gameprotocol.io, however it is unclear what rights and protection there will be for people who decide to back a certain development for game protocol to succeed there needs to be an inventory of high quality projects on the service for the crowd to fund 3/5 ,0
www.gameprotocol.io, team: a strong and extensive team that seems to have an appropriate breadth of knowledge and experience ,1
www.gameprotocol.io, however some of the core members need to update their linkedin profiles as they appear to be working on other projects ,0
www.gameprotocol.io, the team also seems to be spread across multplie locations which may create problems 3/5 ,0
www.gameprotocol.io, product: currently there is an mvp available to test as well as a breakdown of the developers tool in the white paper this is well developed for this stage of the project 4/5,1
www.ecomi.com,vision: a really good idea for the digital collectible world that needs more solutions to support adoption ,1
www.ecomi.com, product : i like the card combining secure cold storage with everyday convenience ,1
www.ecomi.com, this could be more developed ,0
www.ecomi.com, team : expertise and experience aligned with the product ,1
ejacoin.io,vision: a fairly typical blockcahin usage however there are already cryptocurrencies available that provide these services this project will face fierce competition from industry incumbents 2/5,0
ejacoin.io, team: the team appears to be lacking blockchain experience though otherwise has a wide breadth of talent ,1
ejacoin.io, the team could also benefit from additional advisors as there is currently only one in the based locally to the team 3/5 ,0
ejacoin.io, product: there is no mvp available currently though the white paper is there and seems perfectly acceptable ,0
ejacoin.io, i am scoring it with mid marks 3/5,0
socialgood-foundation.com,vision: 4 great vision but there are risks involve to implementing such a great project ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, overall i think society need such a solution but driving such a social innovation is not a simple task it need both monetary power as well as non monetary resources ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, also similar solution exist but off chain ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, most would not join the ecosystem until it show signs of adoption so getting the first few key participant in to start the eco system would therefore be vital ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, product: 3 there is no mention of product ready to be tested ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, while there seem to be no development time line on the site through communications with the team as we mentioned in roadmap and faq construction of the ecosystem is proceeding as a contract of alliance companies ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, would update score again when they post a proper product time line and development timeline also when the product is ready for public testing ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, team: 4 while great experience at banking i would have to say the team comprises of senior management staff with high exposure and experience which is an plus point mr seiichiro yonekura is an expert for social contribution mr yu yamanaka is an expert for blockchain ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, still feel they need a little more social expert and blockchain expert though ,0
socialgood-foundation.com, but overall i would say strong team,1
token.breadapp.com,vision: we are expecting more than a decentralized bank product: a decentralized bank in your hand ,1
token.breadapp.com, first cryptocurrency wallet to provide a loyalty and customer rewards program in the competitive cryptocurrency wallet market ,1
token.breadapp.com, a clean design attractive interface and a strong customer acquisition strategy with a good incentive program for token holders ,1
token.breadapp.com, viability: partner with a variety of financial services institutions to allow for the buying and selling of bitcoin bread simply partners with established third parties in different countries to facilitate the implementation connecting the bitcoin blockchain to mainstream users via an accessible mobile app and other complementary features to support a transition to decentralized banking ,1
token.breadapp.com, although this is a strong structure new technology can make the difference as the adoption is still at the early stage ,0
token.breadapp.com, user value and experience : interactive the bread wallet is a free ios or android download and easy to set up ,1
token.breadapp.com, the simple user interface has options for sending and receiving bitcoins ,1
token.breadapp.com, in the menu option for certain countries there is the ability to buy bitcoin directly from the bread app ,1
token.breadapp.com, brd token holders will also get discounts on bitcoin purchases and other transactions they make on the bread wallet app ,1
token.breadapp.com, team/management: strong team with great experience from famous big blockchain companies ,1
token.breadapp.com, deal structure: integration to clarify ,1
token.breadapp.com, security enhanced there is no registration or personal information collected during the setup process this needs to be clarified during the coming months as mobile system are the hacker target and easy to crack ,0
token.breadapp.com, brd cryptocurrency itself is an erc20 token which means it resides on the ethereum blockchain with potential scalability latency low cost transaction integration ,1
token.breadapp.com, community/customer acquisition strategy: first cryptocurrency wallet to provide a loyalty and customer rewards program in the competitive cryptocurrency wallet market bread has acquired over 650000 customers in over 150 countries the next step is incentivizing people to stay inside the bread ecosystem ,1
bytus.io,vision: it is difficult to say whether or not this idea has a potential for success ,0
bytus.io, on their website it says $175m has already been raised ,1
bytus.io, so over half of the softcap goal has already been reached ,1
bytus.io, team: a sturdy looking team with good advisors ,1
bytus.io, a description on what each team member does would be helpful ,0
bytus.io, kyc passed ,1
bytus.io, product: the basis of this idea is a payment token which depends heavily on partners but i see no mention of any on website or wp ,1
bytus.io, no mvp or product as of yet that i can see ,0
bytus.io, their github only has a forked repository i will change my rating when team provides their promised alpha app ,0
bytus.io, after further investigation i have decided to update my rating ,1
bytus.io, and if a product is provided i will change my rating again,1
www.mydayta.io,vision: i'm a big fan of bloom and these guys are doing something quite similar except with the added twist of allowing users not to just protect their identity and pii but also monetize it bloom only gives users a way to securely make it available to services they want to us dayta provides a means to actively be paid for such data ,1
www.mydayta.io, i can imagine something like dayta being an excellent add on to brave browser where it would automagically use that pii to augment the advertisement selection process and even provide some of that data directly to advertisers before or after ad serving/click through for a fee of course 
www.mydayta.io, i think they also give a good reason for using blockchain ,1
www.mydayta.io, transparency and immutability so those who breach data contracts can be held accountable ,1
www.mydayta.io, in blockchain we trust right? so yes the vision is bang on imo put the data back in the hands of we the people and make those who profit from it pay for it and be accountable for and malfeasance plus make that less likely in the first place ,1
www.mydayta.io, more to the point by making this a more trustworthy process you'll probably find more people actually wanting to share their data under the right terms which dayta lets you define and agree to ,1
www.mydayta.io, team: all the players seem to have pretty solid backgrounds in the field and the stuff they are supposed to be doing with employment histories in well known companies doing those things ,1
www.mydayta.io, some have even built blockchain related projects and companies before which makes them above average imo ,1
www.mydayta.io, product: of course this is all slideware at the moment but i would say their whitepaper is above average and includes quite a lot of details on the various processes and technological decision ,1
www.mydayta.io, they have also put a lot of thought into how it will be used by the various customers for it from consumers to businesses ,1
www.foodnation.io,vision of the project is idealistic but i fail to see a real business model for this project and does not seem to be able to work very realistically would need to see the partners they are working with,0
bytus.io,vision of product is an excellent stop gap measure for the general mass adoption of crytpo through retailer acceptance and issues associated with fiat conversion ,1
bytus.io, once adoption takes hold in the longer term future conversion to fiat may be unwanted or unnecessary and at that point this product will decrease in usage and value ,0
bytus.io, but until that time comes this product is excellent ,1
bytus.io, team is india based and seems to lack diversity and global reach in order to penetrate global markets for mass acceptance ,1
bytus.io, good development but somewhat lacking in marketing go to market strategy ,0
bytus.io, cannot evaluate product whitepaper download unavailable ,0
bytus.io, until then i have standardized product score to 3 which can increase with wp download ,1
tbis.io,vision may be a little too broad ,0
tbis.io, would like to be able to see some kind of focus and a demo of something more details about how plan will be accomplished ,0
tbis.io, rating could be updated as we get more info ,1
medicohealth.io,vision is not unique as i have seen a number of this ico but it is still interesting to me ,1
medicohealth.io,as you have established a strong team with diversified experiences covering most of areas an ico project of this type needs good point ,1
medicohealth.io, the concept as mentioned is not unique but the wp and plan looks feasible so i personally think it can be a great success if you strictly follow with the plan ,1
medicohealth.io, mvp is a great point and i love it very much which is easy to follow and users friendly as well ,1
www.arcona.io,vision is great ,1
www.coinseason.com,vision is good ,1
www.coinseason.com,but competition is high especially with big players ,0
www.coinseason.com, i have a wonder that the project covers many aspects which are ambitious ,1

www.coinseason.com, what if you dont set softcap and not reached hardcap as scheduled? it is my big concern as an investor ,0
xaya.io,vision is good and unique ,1
xaya.io, there are many startups and ecosystems for gaming industry but your concept is unique ,1
xaya.io, team is good but not enough as you need expert on blockchain and game development too ,0
xaya.io, good luck and eager to test this soon ,1
volentix.io,vision and idea are not very original nor new there are already many competitors on the market in which they want to land some of them already work very well they are rich influential and expand more and more ,0
volentix.io, this does not mean that there are no chances for further success on the part of other similar projects but it takes ambition hard work and a well ,1
volentix.io, cohesive team willing to suffer in the early stages of the project ,0
volentix.io, the basic team is a fairly large and well ,1
volentix.io, assigned position but it lacks a bit more experience in some of the profiles and i'm not referring to the blockchain experience but in their sectors of origin ,1
volentix.io, the ceo's linkedin profile can not be opened because it is a non existent page not very welcome while the advisor which are key elements at the blockchain level are missing completely ,0
volentix.io,as they have been running for various conferences for some time some of them have the opportunity to accumulate excellent knowledge and a broader vision which may help you to improve the various areas ,1
volentix.io, social well kept constant updates and not lacking the community as well as the communication channel telegram also well maintained ,1
volentix.io, excellent activity on github constant updates they are working a lot on the product and on the technical part ,1
volentix.io, on the other hand regarding website and whitepaper they are quite poor in content the 3 whitepapers presented contain only technical and technological details very much in the style of the first bitcoin whitepaper but in 2019 this is not enough anymore there are many other aspects that need to be explained and detailed ,0
volentix.io, as a result there are no clear tokenomics and business plans just as the token distribution is also unclear,0 
volentix.io, the roadmap is poor and very little detailed ,0
volentix.io, at a technical technological level the project seems to have all the right credentials to succeed but a very poorly developed and cared in all other aspects ,0
volentix.io, they are still in pre ico so we allow them more time but for now the rating is this good luck in crowdfunding ,1
icobiogen.com,vision and team is good ,1
icobiogen.com, whitepaper needs more information ,0
icobiogen.com, token use needs more clarity and financial structure needs to work upon ,0
icobiogen.com, overall project is promising ,1
icobiogen.com, would like to see progress ,1
investinbrokers.com,vision / product: love the copy trade idea new crypto investors need proven mentors to follow as traditional trading strategies do not often work in these highly speculative environments ,0
investinbrokers.com, business model seems solid and incentivizes the right behavior for all parties ,1
investinbrokers.com, done correctly this platform could be marketed well to exchanges so they do not need to build competing offerings ,1
investinbrokers.com, facets to explore: low barrier to entry ,0
investinbrokers.com, team: great set of advisors ,1
investinbrokers.com,facets to explore: concern about the depth of business experience in the executive team ,0
investinbrokers.com, ceo with limited c level experience may be focus challenged if running two companies reference linkedin ,0
investinbrokers.com, cto doesn’t seem to be directly affiliated with the project reference linkedin ,0

www.uhive.com, executive team seems to have been together at multiple companies good news ,1
www.xcoynz.com,vision : bring a support to adoption users with the wallet and exchange processes ,1
www.xcoynz.com, product : features are quite interesting ,1
www.xcoynz.com, smart algorithm wallet and payment gateway are the best one ,1
www.xcoynz.com, i do appreciate the effort made for the end user to facilitate the experience of token management ,1
www.xcoynz.com, the control of the fee for the exchange is however not based on a clear token economy but the idea to reduce fee is good and needed ,1
www.xcoynz.com, the extension of the credit card is a nice one ,1
www.xcoynz.com, team : good team supported by a lot of advisors ,1
www.xcoynz.com, investors will be attracted by a such model as it is similar to bnb token from binance their success will depend on their capacity to deliver including the customer experience consolidate their token economy and adoption rate ,1
adtoken.com,vision : auditing to detect scam and fraudulent actions in marketing industry is a good thing ,1
adtoken.com, ai can definitely help ,1
adtoken.com, partnership is strong with consensys and microsoft ,1
adtoken.com, team : only manager and expert but developers outsourced by partner,0 
adtoken.com, not at the level of the challenge product: no product/mvp ,0
adtoken.com, 10m$ with no clear product is too much ,0
adtoken.com, a three step of funding would have been more fair ,0
adtoken.com, question: how the money will be really used? and how the reporting will be clearly released to see the delivery of the promise,0
virtue.poker,virtue poker ico review by midgard research: verdict: our grade is 2 out of 10 we don't see any hype around virtue and this is bad for the short term additionally,0
virtue.poker, we don't believe in the project’s long term prospects because of real world competitors ,0
virtue.poker, the company can't propose any really useful applications for mass ,0
virtue.poker, market poker players they are unlikely to use any product this company proposes ,0

namcoin.net, because it is very advanced content it is difficult to understand everything but from this action i feel reliable ,1
sprintx.io,video is delusional at best ,1
sprintx.io, while i love to see projects coming out of latin america this is too much of a money grab ,0

buzcoin.io,very unrealistic hard cap 210mil usd ,0
buzcoin.io, olga buzova she is very famous in russia but it seems like the only reason to have her in this project is to attract unexperienced investors ,0

color-platform.org, puf chip has their own unique digital fingerprints that occur during the manufacturing process of semiconductors and thus can function as a cryptographic identification mechanism capable of signing transactions directly with the other party and greatly increasing transaction speed ,1
color-platform.org,62.5% of tokens are for sale during ico period ,1
color-platform.org, well planned road map ,1
color-platform.org, the color gallery will act as a hub for all the dapps on the color platform ,1
color-platform.org, through the color gallery users will have access to a broad array of decentralized applications and resources ,1
color-platform.org, has multiple tiers: terminal node logic runner and block builder ,1
color-platform.org, telegram channel already got over 45000 active members ,1
color-platform.org, low anonymity of users during pixel distribution is good for legal compliance ,1
color-platform.org, the pixel program prevents the unfair distribution of wealth ,1
color-platform.org, with puf chip lightning fast p2p transactions will be possible weaknesses: bad timing for ico weak investment market investor uncertainty 
color-platform.org, pixels are distributed only among kyc verified users which decreases number of investors ,1
color-platform.org, complicated technical details might scare away potential investors who are not familiar with heavy blockchain and it terminology ,0
color-platform.org, it’s difficult to convince dapp developers to switch from existing platform ,0
color-platform.org, platform includes large functionality: dailytto is a lottery based reward app on blockchain reward inc ,1
color-platform.org, is a reward app that has level up functions to earn points that can be converted to color coins color design stores and manages interior related information on blockchain ,1
color-platform.org, such a focus dispersion can lead to unfinished/bugged dapps ,0
color-platform.org, mvp is not ready yet i wanted to deduct at least one point for mvp absence but after long conversation with color team members i came to conclusion that product is worthy i always prefer platform tokens over dapp tokens because platform value can be leveraged significantly through success of dapps built on the top of it ,1
color-platform.org, this project has impressive team with strong it background that could reveal full potential of this project ,1
color-platform.org, colors has firm competitive advantage: color spectrum technology ,1
color-platform.org, it consists of distinct tiers for data processing and committing data into blockchain enabling high speed transactions and solving scalability issue observed in many other blockchain projects ,1

fysical.org,very sound project with many compelling business use cases ,1
fysical.org, the team have solid experience and it seems that the product is coming along well ,1
fysical.org, data is the new oil and location is the new drill ,1

coindaily.io, the major funds and investors are interested in the project ,1
coindaily.io, they have huge partnerships with binance and okex ,1
coindaily.io, token metrics look reasonable and we can see the real usage of a token ,1
coindaily.io, keep waiting to see their mvp in the nearest future ,1
uncloak.io,very solid team with deep experience int he cyber security threat space ,1
uncloak.io, excellent use of the blockchain because for better or worse the blockchain is connected to the internet ,1
uncloak.io, the ability to proactively screen for security threats and stop them before they start would make uncloak the homeland security of cyber space ,1
uncloak.io, they have a working prototype and i will revise my product rating when they release their mvp ,1
uncloak.io, their community seems to be active and growing with 27k telegram members i observed people that were concerned about the project and asking intelligent questions ,1
uncloak.io, the tokenomics for the project are acceptable with a $20 million hard cap and 50% of the tokens being distributed the crowdsale,1

mapcoin.io, good use case of blockchain for incentivising and allowing infrastructure to operate ,1

blockchain.io, they also started paymium which i am familiar with ,1
blockchain.io, i like the fact that they are ahead of the curve with implementing kyc and security protection for their platform which will be a future requirement for all trading platforms ,1
blockchain.io, one small not pierre noizat's linkedin profile link is not showing on the team section this needs to be updated ,0
www.concertvr.io,very smart ,1
www.concertvr.io, having spent a few years in the music industry i am well aware that artists need new channels to create revenue since downloading and streaming have more or less killed them off ,1
www.concertvr.io, this is a great idea with a solid team based out of germany and for those in the know ,1
www.concertvr.io, know eventim who rule europe teutonic efficiency ,1
eiracube.io,very smart idea ,1
eiracube.io, i have seen the rise of rent a shelf and popups here in the netherlands rise as traditional brick and mortar retail is bumped due to online shopping ,1
eiracube.io, very clean whitepaper to boot ,1
eiracube.io, well done it's refreshing to see something new in the ico arena ,1
www.b21.io,very small team to be able to pull of what hey say in heir whitepaper ,0
www.b21.io, maybe they need to enhance the information given build a stronger team and set more realistic milestones ,0
loligo.co,very small team and yet they managed to somehow put together an mvp ,1
loligo.co, you should recruit more people on board ,0
loligo.co,as an ico is a serious business and you need people in charge of many aspects not just the product itself ,1
loligo.co, [later edit] thank you for your fast clarification in the reply it shows that you indeed do care about your project ,1
www.tn-crypto.com,very small team although i really like the concept of having more reliable news sources ,0
www.tn-crypto.com, i think some partnerships and user acquisitions can make this project really successful ,0
www.tn-crypto.com,as it will need a huge amount of users to make it more reliable ,0
www.tn-crypto.com, good luck team!,1
www.casperproject.io,very simple and reasonable business model ,1
www.casperproject.io, moreover i also like the ui that valued investors and users ,1
www.casperproject.io, the rationale for the white paper is also strongly established ,1
www.casperproject.io, i hope this business will succeed ,1
www.casperproject.io, the screen of demo is simple and very user friendly ,1
www.casperproject.io, i am a little worried that the time required for uploading is a bit longer ,0
www.casperproject.io, but this will also be improved ,1
www.casperproject.io, i perfectly understand that perfect translation of all languages is a difficult task but there are many unclear points the rate of 25.6 gb for 1 cst ,0
www.casperproject.io, but if the price rises as the popularity of cst rises will it be a burden to users? also taking into consideration that this is ico i am relieved that there are members who have made ico successful for team members ,1
ewaiter.io,very short wp without must have information such as financials competitive analyses blockchain advantages etc,0 
ewaiter.io, so it demonstrates low readiness to the ico and the team should be reinforced with international experts with more business and blockchain experience,0
sprintx.io,very shady project ,0
sprintx.io, i see nothing there for investor gain with the model they are offering ,0
sprintx.io, project seems very greedy and has no interest in the investor long term ,0
sprintx.io, another weird stuff is their pr ,0
sprintx.io,team just spammed my linkedin without explanations willing to provide screenshots to ones interested ,0
sprintx.io, fail to see mvp as well ,0
mobeetel.co,very shady ico with a very weak team and no clear vision ,0
mobeetel.co, be very careful! i suggest you talk to their ceo before even considering an investment ,0
mobeetel.co, i wish i've rated it earlier so it would save more of the fellow community members of investing in this scamlike project,0
www.hashcard.io,very serious integrity issues in core team!! ,0
www.hashcard.io,it seems to have mvp and even have app in apple store all the surface works there make everyone including many ico experts believe it is a good product a real one and practically to support their biz model and yet they defense the rumors at very beginning which confuse the public again many investors suffer a great lost and nothing can do to them for now! face the public and don't think about you guys can hide forever!!,0
faceter.io,very sensitive problem to solve and a really good vision of how to tackle it ,1
teachmeplease.io,very self confident team probably too much ,0

tokensale.moozicore.com, that’s good news and reduces risk for the next steps ,1
tokensale.moozicore.com, mega trend market ,1
tokensale.moozicore.com, but not easy to attack ,0
tokensale.moozicore.com, a project that really fits to the need of blockchain technology all the bests for the next steps ,1
solarex.io,very responsive team ,1
solarex.io, all questions were answered in a very professional way ,1
solarex.io, they have everything in place: social media channels etc ,1

solarex.io, most important will be good cooperations and jv with the relevant players ,1

solarex.io, but i like the vision to make a better world with blockchain ,1
www.datablockchain.io,very refreshing to see such industry experience and business knowledge in an ico ,1

www.datablockchain.io, well done ,1
www.zeex.me,very refined looking project with amazing possibilities and the first company i've seen to allow people to use crypto payments in stores ,1
www.zeex.me, i give this protocol a 9/10 and 10/10 if they succeed with their goals ,1
sonder.vision,very reasonable hard cap and low valuation to start with which is great for potential upside ,1
sonder.vision,though makes it challenging to scale and gain a lot of traction quickly ,0
sonder.vision, probably not as sexy as most of the highly hyped infrastructure projects that are currently out there raising but appears to be useful solution ,0
sonder.vision, they are driving at and looking forward to seeing how this works out ,1
sonder.vision, i like to see a roadmap that extends out at least a few years to show the team has a well thought out master plan have a bigger vision than just the initial product and way to grow adoption with targets to get to the level necessary to make it a viable project in the long run,1 
crucoins.com,very raw at this stage ,0
crucoins.com, this ico needs to include more information on what their plans are and the personalities behind the company ,0
gcox.com,very questionable team found multiple advisors with questionable reputation within the community ,0
gcox.com, vision is a bit clearer but yet we have seen multiple projects that have tried it ,1
gcox.com, could be that this project could actually pull this off ,1
gcox.com,but i fail to believe in it personally and i would have to see a strong alpha version of the project working right before i do ,0

alphatechnology.io, there are many strong competitors on this crowded space ,0
traxion.tech,very pleased to see the company and the listing progressing so well,1
www.dnatix.com,very perspective project,1
www.eraswaptoken.io,very obviously either paying or using incentives to play with ratings and cheat the rating systems so lack of integroty shown by either team or their advisors i have never seen an advisor roster this big they have a bigger bench than a nfl team i cannot udnerstand how a team that big as advisors can be either productive or add value seeing all will want a piece of the pie ,0
www.eraswaptoken.io, very unusual set up and overall doesnt stack up,0
www.blockshipping.io,very obvious and smart use of the technology ,1
www.blockshipping.io, bold team looks promising and capable of handling the implementation ,1
www.blockshipping.io, however a bit of a red flag for me is a lack of an mvp and a product by itself ,0
www.blockshipping.io, hope that the project will be able to take care of it before the ico starts ,1

www.travala.com, good team and advisers ,1
egold.trade,very little team ,0
egold.trade, yet not passed kyc verification ,0
egold.trade, about vision lots of competition in the market right now ,0
egold.trade, i don't think this will be an good investment ,0
egold.trade, i don't think this project will give you any roi ,0
kingdomofprivelege.com,very little information ,0
kingdomofprivelege.com, two team members both with title of ceo ,0
kingdomofprivelege.com, little experience ,0
kingdomofprivelege.com, white paper is not congruent with project description ,0
kingdomofprivelege.com, seems to be a mashup of other content ,0
kingdomofprivelege.com, recommend avoid this ico unless founders can provide more information ,0
pig.world,very little information on the project ,0
pig.world, there is little to nothing information on team members ,0
pig.world, the mission of the project is good to create a decentralized casino with fair 0% betting fees ,1
pig.world, there needs to be more transparency with the team members ,0
www.fissacoin.com,very light team and advisory group ,0
www.fissacoin.com, lack of real product ,0
vault.tools,very less information about the ico also team is lacking in experience and knowledge ,0
vault.tools, team also does not have any links to any of the social media profile ,0
viewo.com,very large advisory board which is good ,1
viewo.com, but i would have liked to see more members on the team as well ,0
viewo.com, there is ample opportunity and the vision is grand ,1
viewo.com, i would however have liked to see more videos and at least an explainer video especially if youre promoting a video sharing platform! overall a project that is good but could be great with some small changes ,1
www.rewardprotocol.com,very intriguing project indeed ,1
www.rewardprotocol.com, simple yet effective presentation video clear whitepaper and vision ,1
www.rewardprotocol.com, firstly the team is mature experienced and confident that they will successfully complete this concept and turn it into a reliable product ,1
www.rewardprotocol.com, secondly sharing data around this blockchain ecosystem can prove to be very useful especially in the very near future and this is something that will attract a very large number of people and i’m not talking just about crypto members but people from all around the globe from different backgrounds ,1
www.rewardprotocol.com, i believe that the reward system via the smart contract will be the main element that will pull most of this projects enthusiasts ,1
www.rewardprotocol.com, the problem comes done on adoption issues since a vision alone is not enough ,0
www.blockshipping.io,very intriguing concept the shipping industry can certainly use a way to track containers using blockchain ,1
www.blockshipping.io, the team seems to have some relevant experience and seems fairly well established ,1
www.blockshipping.io, no crypto influencers or superstars per se but that is not necessarily a deal breaker ,1
www.blockshipping.io, the idea is not wholly original but its the team and execution that you are betting on ,1
www.blockshipping.io, the market maker fund is an interesting concept to ensure that the tokens have some value ,1
www.blockshipping.io, overall certainly piques my interest ,1
www.blockshipping.io, worth watching to see how things turn out ,1
nortonchain.io,very interesting ,1
nortonchain.io, maybe more detail about a team of this program ,0
nortonchain.io, i wish any bounty campaign in the project dev,1
adhive.tv,very interesting ,1
adhive.tv, video and speech recognition is high ,1
www.tokenaire.club,very interesting way to monetize social networking and engagement ,1
www.tokenaire.club, would like to see more details though ,1
www.tokenaire.club, the team needs to be stronger i feel ,0
www.tokenaire.club, the vision s definitely strong ,1
www.tokenaire.club, there's a lot of scope there ,0
www.tokenaire.club, the whitepaper is lacking some key information ,0
www.tokenaire.club, the roadmap is definitely lacking a lot of information ,0
www.tokenaire.club, the hardcap i don't understand the need for 
www.tokenaire.club, side notes i really think you may need more than 50% towards marketing if you really need a social platform to crack the mainstream but depends on the strategy ,0
www.tokenaire.club, secondly you should seriously think of removing the when of the token burn strategy because it's going to cause major volatility to your value and completely kill your long term value and therefore investment potential ,0
www.4new.io,very interesting vision i think it is a very good use of a blockchain network ,1
www.4new.io, i would love to see it live ,1
www.4new.io, very big team and advisory board! good luck team!,1

www.avinoc.com, costs for flights are still very high for most travelers and integrating this data layer would help a lot to optimize the industry ,1
cotrader.com,very interesting use of blockchain to disrupt how investment funds will work ,1
cotrader.com, good commercial marketplace model ,1
cotrader.com, highly disruptive but untested yet regulatory and commercial pickup so risk is definitely there ,1
www.mevu.bet,very interesting the vision certainly innovative and does not appear to be the classic gambling project adapted in blockchain of which we are now bored ,1
www.mevu.bet, great team with key figures for development good activity on the channels and above all on github which is important being a quite dev project ,1
www.mevu.bet, great mvp offers a good overview of the facts and connects easily with metamask ,1
www.mevu.bet, the only thing is that i failed to identify the token distribution while there is some confusion with the roadmap the ico should have ended in december 2018 while in march 2019 it is still active ,0
www.mevu.bet, all in all a good project with a team that seems able to bring it to success ,1
nodepower.io,very interesting tech with an amazing potential ,1
nodepower.io, all the best!,1
one.game,very interesting project ,1
one.game, tokenized economies are perfect for these kind of games ,1
one.game, second life is the perfect example that there is a huge market for these projects and that people are willing to spend money on it ,1
one.game, ico cap seems a bit high but still reasonable ,1
ucoincurrency.io,very interesting project ,1
ucoincurrency.io, the team is superb and i doubt you can get a better team in terms of their experience in financial systems ,1
ucoincurrency.io, yet one has to wonder how ucoin can be any different of the many cryptocurrencies with the same mission ,0
ucoincurrency.io, nevertheless good luck! very impressive team!,1
whyral.network,very interesting project ,1
whyral.network, looking forward to seeing where this one goes!,1

dataeum.com,very interesting project ,1
dataeum.com, i really like the vision and the team behind it ,1
dataeum.com, clearly the type of solution that this project is approaching makes it for blockchain technology a perfect use case ,1
dataeum.com, i don't clearly understand how will this data be utilized and monetized as the business model behind the concept is a bit confusing ,0
www.hldycoin.com,very interesting project ,1
www.hldycoin.com, i read whitepaper and roadmap i think you guys will be absolutely succeed ,1

buratino.io, that is why gave 5 score for team and in this project they already have working product and for that reason gave them 5 rating as well for product,1
crowdvilla.io,very interesting project with a grand vision ,1
crowdvilla.io, however reality checks in and after reading the full whitepaper i have to admit i'm highly sceptical about crowdvillas future ,0
crowdvilla.io, the business model suggested around the token contains not a few but a host of issues not answered in the wp ,0
crowdvilla.io, i read dozens of whitepapers every week and it took me a couple of good read throughs to understand this one it's far too complicated for average crypto ,0
crowdvilla.io, joe being savvy in tokenized business models i love this in theory ,1
crowdvilla.io, in practice it doesn't cut it too much uncertanity around implementation and a business model far too complex kills it ,0
www.otppay.io,very interesting project with a good team ,1
uncloak.io,very interesting project using eos to push forward a commercial product ,1
uncloak.io, in todays context this is the right time to do this ,1
qiibee.com,very interesting project that uses a token with a very specific utility use case ,1

cryptocurve.io, i think cryptocurve can do very well because it isn't only one of the first dapps on wanchain but also a very interesting product that can grow more in years as the adoption rate gets higher especially through their sdk which can make the job easier for other developers ,1
cryptocurve.io, cool project and good luck!,1
javvy.com,very interesting product i like it a lot ,1

genexi.io, great team and advisory board ,1
www.humanixr.com,very interesting platform ,1
www.humanixr.com, i feel that the success of this platform is also the marketing that this company can create to promote the daily tasks that will be provided on the app ,1
www.humanixr.com, great team ,1
joytoken.io,very interesting perspective!,1
jibrel.network,very interesting idea!,1
www.poolofstake.io,very interesting idea with clear vision ,1
www.poolofstake.io, appreciate the fact that mvp is there already ,1
www.poolofstake.io, would recommend the project to put more real working advisors on the board and less mass advisors from the real people who can help them grow ,0
foam.space,very interesting idea that can totally use a blockchain technology implementation ,1
foam.space, their idea of a location protocol based on the ethereum network is very unique ,1
foam.space, good luck team!,1
eiracube.io,very interesting idea good luck guys!,1

tecracoin.io, the project has all the trades in its team and the wp is well done ,1

www.taurus.io,very interesting concept ,1
www.taurus.io, promising team with kyc passed ,1
www.taurus.io, would like to see some kind of proof of concept to say more ,0
www.taurus.io, marketing could use a bit of polishing especially content part of it ,0
www.donocle.io,very interesting concept ,1
www.donocle.io, lottery and blockchain goes well ,1
www.donocle.io, blockchain provides visibility and clarity to lottery winners ,1
www.donocle.io, team looks really good and domain experts ,1
www.donocle.io, whitepaper is detailed and token economics is good ,1
www.donocle.io, best of luck team ,1
peculium.io,very interesting concept ,1
peculium.io, looking forward to investing and being an active member of the community ,1
www.sapien.network,very interesting concept ,1
www.sapien.network, looking forward for it ,1
www.virtualrehab.co,very interesting concept ,1
www.virtualrehab.co, i am just a little wary on the need of blockchain for this project ,0
www.virtualrehab.co, although this seems a great opportunity to help people in populations where treatment may not be available that easily as rehabilitation requires a very special kind of experts ,1
zerostate.io,very interesting concept ,1
zerostate.io, excited to see more ei come into the social media world ,1
zerostate.io, currently as an advertising centric platform i don't see a lot of scope for growth realistically especially given how difficult it will potentially be to crack into this market ,0
zerostate.io, but definitely interesting use case and am excited to see what can come off it ,1
icobiogen.com,very interesting concept with a definitely original vision after all ,1
icobiogen.com,how many of us had imagined that with the help of the blockchain human life would have been extended on average 40/50 years! adopt the blockchain only to raise funds creating a token that does not make sense it makes no sense to buy it and it makes no sense to hold it and whose role in an ecosystem is not understood i do not know how the right solution is ,0
icobiogen.com, blockchain is not a system to raise funds more easily no the blockchain is another thing much more important and beneficial than is believed ,0
icobiogen.com, a large and fairly experienced team in their areas of provenance but i have not seen any blockchain developer any programmer or any doctor/researcher in the staff ,0
icobiogen.com, a lot of advisor some business person that's all ,0
icobiogen.com, there are no constant activities on social networks and communication channels while the community is missing the blog which should be updated and full of content is open less than a month ago and with poor activity ,0
icobiogen.com, on github obviously there is no activity but needless to say as it is not understood what product is developing why blockchain and where will end the investor's money ,0
icobiogen.com, in the case of not having collected the minimum target of $ 3000000 the sale period may be extended until the end of december 2019 phrase taken from the whitepaper what makes you think that if you have not reached the softcap in 9 months will you reach it within the 3 month extension? synthetic website 2/3 information small presentation as well as the whitepaper a couple of promises 2 problems 2 solutions and a financial plan from which can not understand the tokenomics nor the business model ,0
icobiogen.com, abysmal difference between the softcap 3m and the hardcap 400m if you need 400m to reach your goal what would you do with 3m ?? surely the intention is a noble one and the whole humanity would thank in case of success but guys you can not launch an ico on this or at least not in these conditions and with these parameters ,0
icobiogen.com, in my opinion you would have a lot more success outside of the blockchain with this idea maybe elaborated a little better and with a little more effort p.s. ,0
icobiogen.com, the whitepaper leaves us with the phrase joint us today ! in fact also a joint is shown to have positive effects on health ,1
www.swace.io,very interesting concept of the project and i see a strong team executing it ,1
www.swace.io, hoping to see the launch of the app product soon as they promise ,1
www.swace.io, would like to see some experts/advisors joining the team as well ,0
phoneum.io,very interesting concept i would love to see mining incorporated as a mobile app ,0
phoneum.io, experienced team i would like to see how the concept does in practice ,1
teachmeplease.io,very interesting concept and vision ,1
teachmeplease.io, experience team ,1
teachmeplease.io, i am not sure of the use of blockchain in this project and believe it may be a little too centralized but since it is based on a trust concept it may be a good idea ,1
www.roomdao.io,very interesting concept and product ,1
www.roomdao.io, the tourist industry is an old fashioned industry waiting to be revolutionized ,1
www.roomdao.io, although it is also a niche with a lot of competition and there are different platforms that aim to charge 0% of fees yet there aren't massively adopted alternatives to the typical business model yet so it would be very interesting to see if roomdao can become the new standard in the category ,1
www.scienceroot.com,very interesting concept and great mission ,1
www.scienceroot.com, i wonder if we really need blockchain technology in this project or at least at this stage ,0
www.scienceroot.com, the team looks very experienced ,1
www.ubex.com,very interesting concept and big and experienced team ,1
www.ubex.com, i think that ai in advertising can be extremely helpful although there are a few firms tackling on this project ,1

elementsestates.io,very interesting commercial idea ,1
elementsestates.io, i can see deployment here and the team looks serious and with the right competencies to actually carry this through ,1
elementsestates.io, will follow this closely ,1
depository.network,very interesting coin ,1
madana.io,very interesting certainly innovative vision and does not appear to be the classic privacy project adapted in blockchain of which we are now bored ,1
madana.io, privacy is very important and is a factor that has been neglected in recent years and people have found themselves in complicated situations without their fault so a lot of attention must be paid to this aspect ,1
madana.io, excellent team with key figures for development good activity on the channels and above all on github which is important since it is a pretty dev project ,1
madana.io,but not very international and maybe a more experienced blockchain developer is missing ,0
madana.io, there is no mvp yet and there are no official dates for various processes such as ico or other updates ,0
madana.io, distribution of the token fairly balanced as well as all tokenomics ,1
madana.io, it is probably early to make a definitive judgment but they are not working badly ,1
madana.io, all in all a good project with a team that seems able to bring it to success ,1
squarex.io,very interesting business area,1
squarex.io, but hard cap is too high ,0

www.satt-token.com,very good team and advisors saw them at blockshow in singapore very dedicated and hardworking team ,1
www.satt-token.com, also they have real marketing experience which is a plus point ,1
www.satt-token.com, certainly we can see application ready for use in the market ,1
www.satt-token.com, i am giving a 5 for vision because i feel that while they have great understanding of market and know what they wish to do limiting to facebook might lower the potential maybe the ico themselves can comment on potential to expand beyond fb ,1

oni.fund,very good,1
ausdigitaldollar.online,very good,1
ausdigitaldollar.online,very good,1
ico.enkronos.com,very funny ,1
ico.enkronos.com,the first unethical thing is to ask for 500000 ethereum as a hard cap for a piece of software ,0
the product is not even there and there is almost no demand at all for such technology it would add no value to the blockchain system adding many people to the team does not make it credible ,0
ico.enkronos.com, this is an over valued project that in my opinion would not create any value to businesses and investors as well ,0
ico.enkronos.com, 0% chance to succeed big red flag ,0
www.arcona.io,very few devs on the team ,0
www.arcona.io, the idea is nice,1

jullar.io,very creative idea cool specialists and i am sure that the project will quickly grow into something serious!,1

www.ticko.io, interestingly enough the airline ticketing industry didn't change much in the last few years and we all know the pain of changing tickets ,1
www.ticko.io, i believe this ico can be very successful if there are partnerships in place with airlines and travel providers ,1
www.ticko.io, the team seems small although i understand it is normal at this stage ,1

quant.network, i think it's will gonna boom,1
www.stopthefakes.io,very big vision but mass ,1
www.stopthefakes.io, adoption and technical delivery will be challenging in my opinion ,0

www.stopthefakes.io, but not much of blockchain related track records ,0
tokensale.lynked.world,very big team from india which has done a great job at home if to look at partner agreements ,1
tokensale.lynked.world, it really impresses ,1
tokensale.lynked.world, very strong advisors are picked also up ,1
tokensale.lynked.world, separately i have looked at white paper and have seen that it is consists very thoroughly as any serious business project and translated to many languages ,1
tokensale.lynked.world, for this separate thanks and respect! the idea is pleasant to me,1
tokensale.lynked.world, but i don't think that it can be realized at the global level,0
tokensale.lynked.world, on the other hand already now many partnerships and if this project helps at least only to india it already means that the world will become a little better ,1
tokensale.lynked.world, i wish you good luck!,1
sonder.vision,very bad impressions about this project ,0
sonder.vision, team is not answering on time in social network ,0
sonder.vision, it is looking like only one person behind this ico ,0
sonder.vision, vision is also not good one because all they wait is only when eth will reach $400 price ,0
sonder.vision, there is no live product as well ,0
bithemoth.com,very average team ,0
bithemoth.com, very weak white paper ,0
bithemoth.com, the project tries to make directly 6 directions and it means that all directions will be weak,0 
bithemoth.com, all strong projects are focused on one in the beginning and already then step by step expand the directions it is also visible that the team lacks the international experience ,0
ico.bailsman.co,very average idea which meet every month ,0
ico.bailsman.co, huge competition ,0
ico.bailsman.co, 10 million euros for very average idea ,0
ico.bailsman.co, very poorly trust in it ,0

www.dorado.tech, the team's ability to execute and make this project a success is a question mark regardless this impressive statistics,0
www.multiversum.io,very ambitious project the team seems very competent and experienced working hard i believe they will achieve their goals ,1
www.multiversum.io, the idea is one of the best of this year for me it would finally make the blockchain useful for many things in real life ,1
www.multiversum.io, the whitepaper is complete and full of information ,1
www.multiversum.io, the roadmap is also well structured ,1
ico.meetngreetme.com,very ambitious project with an extreme range of services related to travelling ,1
ico.meetngreetme.com, team on the other hand does not have a global presence or strong financial partners ,0
www.bitcanna.io,very ambitious project too ambitious actually ,0
www.bitcanna.io, own blockchain payment solution supply chain solution rating identity you name it that is not good since it's million times harder to execute ,0
www.bitcanna.io, if they would choose one and then take on the rest if the first step is successful it would be much less risky ,0
www.bitcanna.io, they do know their market and have partnership relationships which is very positive ,1
i-chain.net,very ambitious project that will have hard time delivering on its business development,0 
i-chain.net, 100k eth soft cap is 2 orders of magnitude too much for crowdfunding ,0
i-chain.net, team does not have global presence that the project of this scale requires ,0
i-chain.net, idea is good but proposed approach and scale look too risky for me as i prefer to see success on several fronts ,0
i-chain.net,mvp demo is good ,1
i-chain.net, there are those that think big right away this project is for them if they believe in the team and vision ,1
baanx.com,very ambitious project responding to a real need on the market ,1
baanx.com, can succeed as long as there is no competition from existing banks that want to enter the crypto market ,0
baanx.com, the team behind the project seems not to be crypto oriented,0
baanx.com, but have a big experience in the banking world ,1
www.silkchain.io,very ambitious project but is difficult to implement ,0
www.silkchain.io, 55 000 eth soft cap? i am not sure it will be achieved ,0
www.silkchain.io, in the second quarter of 2019 the stated cooperation with the bank of bahrain see no confirmation this ,0
www.silkchain.io, marketing and advertising project is not very global so i doubt in achieving software cap ,0
www.silkchain.io, community 10 million people? do not see the proof of this ,0
www.silkchain.io, stated 100 team members but on the icobench see other number of people ,0
www.silkchain.io, this is the tenth project which states that he blockchain 3.0 20% of tokens for the founders and team ?? you seriously? only 25% of tokens for sale high risk for investment ,0
www.silkchain.io, not found mvp ,0
www.silkchain.io,update: mvp is ready issues was fixed,1
keplertek.io,very ambitious project know personally founder has mvp great and experienced advisory board all is looking good here for me georgia is crypto friendly country and do business there is good decision,1
faceter.io,very ambitious goals,1
faceter.io, however it's nice to see a fresh idea in the space ,1
www.timebox.network,very amazing mission for this project ,1
www.timebox.network, very experienced team and advisory board ,1
www.timebox.network, and the vision of this ico is great ,1

cubomania.io,very amazing idea and use of blockchain ,1
cubomania.io, very experienced team with background with education which makes them great for this kind of platform,1

dacc.co,veru nice,1
ndexnetwork.com,verry fine ,1
verime.mobi,verime great and stable ico ,1
www.skelpy.co,verification of identity by certification of portfolios something sounding technically to me ,1

dacc.co,veri nice good,1
daostack.io,verdict: 8 out of 10 daostack is a promising project with an all star team which aims to create a simple framework for creating and managing daos like wordpress for non blockchain apps ,1
daostack.io, there is already a working product on a testnet and the team plans to release it on a mainnet in april ,1
daostack.io, daostack has partnerships with other solid blockchain projects such as endor sapien network and gnosis as well as with funds and software development companies ,1
daostack.io, still there is a lack of information about use of proceeds and no roadmap ,0
daostack.io, competition is low in this sphere there is only one direct competitor aragon which has made 3x since its ico current marketcap of $77m and it has almost the same hardcap $30m as daostack ,1
www.metronome.io, verdict: 7.5 out of 10 the project has all ,1
www.metronome.io, star team members and advisors ,1
www.metronome.io, the idea is unique and the growth potential is large ,1
www.metronome.io, however our participation will mostly depend on the progress of the descending dutch auction ,0
kora.network,verdict: 3.5 out of 10 the idea of the project is great but it is too far from realization ,0
kora.network, the team lacks experience for such ambitious ideas and plans ,0
kora.network, we find the planned allocation of their funds ridiculous 30% for onboarding users to the network and 10% primarily for seed funding startups that build value added applications on the kora network ,0
kora.network, the tokenomics of the project will not bring large returns on investments in the short term ,0
kora.network, even in the long term kora network have to compete with other projects in this field ,0
kora.network, it is also worth mentioning two redflags found during our research: redflag!!! there are many accounts bots in their telegram group which send same messages about how great the project is ,0
kora.network, they ask the same questions again and again even after receiving answers!!! redflag!!! admins from the telegram group deleted my messages about competitors until i said i was doing research on their project ,0
kora.network, they said that bots deleted my messages not them however my messages disappeared after one to two minutes not immediately ,0
ausdigitaldollar.online,veey powerful and promising project,1
vectorspace.ai,vectorspace ai platform enables dynamically generated intelligent token baskets based on user selected trends that exist in search social media and news ,1
vectorspace.ai, wow i would rate 0 but i cant,0
dexacoin.net,vast amount of the companies wanna make crypto useful and easy to use and understand to all the people worldwide ,1
dexacoin.net, but actually few of them really offer a feasibility to solve people's problem which really matters this project go to solve it at all the stages: global money transfer and instant messaging very easy to use mobile application even with basic knowledge of using smartphone social messaging tool etc ,1
dexacoin.net, sounds really cool when people abroad could for tiny fee send money to their family and close folks ,1
dexacoin.net, this could be game changer for crypto adoption with valuable usage ,1
dexacoin.net, looking forward for make this idea happen ,1
www.varanida.com,varanida takes a fresh approach on the advertising network ,1
www.varanida.com, i think decentralizing the ad network will help revolutionize the way we consume ads ,1
www.varanida.com, the team has a strong background ,1
www.varanida.com, the business revenue model makes sense and i think this platform will be a preferred choice for both advertisers and consumers,1

vanta.network, blockchain testnet is scheduled for 2019 q2 mainnet is scheduled for 2019 q3 ,1
vanta.network, peer analysis shows that vanta’s competitors do not perform well probably because of the bear market ,1
vanta.network, all competitors performed well in short term showing positive roi ,1
vanta.network, note: the main advantage of ieo is an instant liquidity ,1
vanta.network, tokenomics looks reasonable hard cap $15m ,1
vanta.network, there are lock up terms for the team advisors early supporters ,1
vanta.network, staking model will prevent token from dumping and the price will grow as long as more companies and developers will join vanta network ,1
vanta.network,vanta is a strong project project that offers a blockchain based ecosystem offering low cost functional blockchain based network that can be used by anyone via an api sdk or customisable modules that integrate with applications or platforms currently in use ,1
vanta.network, vanta can expand its ecosystem through these modules in order to integrate current systems that require real time networking functionality ,1
vanta.network, the team behind the project state that vanta is a decentralized and permissionless network that ensures real time secure and private connectivity and they envisage that their networking technology will cover a wide range of use cases these include messaging file transfer voice and video call development large scale real ,1
vanta.network, time video streaming and the transmission and processing of real time data collected from iot sensors wide range of use cases that
vanta.network, i believe the team can implement successfully in time ,1
vanta.network, the team is solid and combines significant experience at companies such as apple microsoft apple oracle samsung ibm korea and voiceloco with the latter also providing significant backing and assistance ,1

vanta.network, vanta as a company has a large scope and the team’s vision is to reach for the stars ,1
vanta.network, they are ambitious and judging by their previous accomplishments and the network architecture they presented we believe vanta has a good chance to eventually become a solid player in the decentralized industry ,1

www.vanm.io, business strategy good view of the necessities of the advertising industry and long term business strategies planned ,1
www.vanm.io, resilience good choice of advisors working from long time in the advertising industry ,1
bitcar.io,valuations seems a bit stellar,1
somesing.io,valid and convincing use case for the blockchain ,1
somesing.io, highly commercial project and team has the track record necessary for a project of this scale and deployability ,1
somesing.io, will follow the measured progress ,1
about.v-id.org,v id is a very interesting project and has great potential especially when it reaches critical mass and wide spread adoption ,1
about.v-id.org, the one factor that should be considered is v id acceptance and validation in court and more specifically in jurisdictions around the world ,0
about.v-id.org, this project is innovative and could achieve great success hence 5 stars for vision ,1
about.v-id.org, as mentioned in the v id white paper there's another ico civic doing something similar with regards id and documents validation and that could present a challenge in the near future ,0
about.v-id.org, as v id is already established and revenue positive with customer traction it gives v id the comparative advantage ,1
about.v-id.org, first mover advantage plays a big role as once networks effects have permeated the v id blockchain system by a significant number of participants the tendency is to stick with the same system ,1
about.v-id.org, adoption usage and court legality need to be re considered in a borderless environment which will be challenging therefore 4 stars for product ,1
about.v-id.org, the team appears to be very experienced 15 20+ years and each has extensive expertise in their own domain ,1
about.v-id.org, already having 2 lawyers on the team is very useful with regards to v id validation and acceptance as well as court legality and admissibility ,1
about.v-id.org, two advisors is in my opinion not sufficient enough and should include some more outside expertise and talent to strengthen the advisor board,0 
about.v-id.org, taking into consideration team talent and expertise a 5 stars is given for the team ,1
about.v-id.org, good luck to the v id team !,1
blockchain.aero,v interesting idea could be cool ,1
blockchain.aero, look forward to learning more about it ,1

jobeum.com,ust found out about this ico and brought a few tokens using the latest innovation in distributed systems design we are aiming to be the next generation infrastructure for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem ,1
herdius.com, unfortunately 2 of your kycs failed in icobench ,0
lytictail.io,using iota platform but not much information,0
omnitude.tech,using hyperledger is good ,1
omnitude.tech, lacking a proper mvp / use cases / proven track record of success before launching the ico is risky ,0
omnitude.tech, the team lacks any core developers from the ones working on the technologies they claim to integrate ,0
omnitude.tech, this is odd even the list of advisors lacks known names in the field ,0
amo.foundation,using amo coin it is possible to find a single source that can provide all kinds of information regarding cars the platform uses blockchain technology to reduce costs as well as improve efficiencies of delivery this could turn out to be the meeting spot for manufacturers and consumers of products for cars and even the automobile ancillaries ,1
amo.foundation, it must be said that the fact that there really is no controlling entity to the system would make it widely accepted too ,1
gabrotech.io,using a common digital asset gabro gbos our token will be the medium of exchange as well as will link all the merchant tokens and provide a means to provide the market value as it will be listed in the crypto exchange ,1
www.howdoo.io,users will be able to choose the number and content of advertisements with howdoo howdoo is a decentralized social platform based on blockchain technology ,1
www.howdoo.io, it aims to address the social and economic problems that exist in the social platforms ,1
www.howdoo.io, since advertising is the main revenue stream for the existing social platforms they treat their users as passive consumers of content and advertisement for this reason a central body determines who where and when to advertise meanwhile advertisers offer distinct commercial packages to distribute their messages on the contrary users have no control on the advertisement traffic ,1
www.howdoo.io, howdoo will provide users and communities payments for the advertisements they have agreed to consume ,1
www.howdoo.io, in addition users as individual or communities will have two options either adjusting the amount of advertisement they are going to consume or not to see any at all ,1
www.howdoo.io, those who accept to consume advertisements will be rewarded by the percentage depends on the overall proof of contribution score of advertisement fees paid in μdoo tokens by advertisers ,1
www.howdoo.io, howdoo is ready to disrupt social network industry with addition of payment options via cryptocurrency ,1
www.howdoo.io,users want better compensation for their contribution,1
www.howdoo.io,users can not regulate the advertising they see ,0
www.howdoo.io, there is only one solution around and it is adblocker there are 615 million devices that use adblocker around the world today with a 30% year on year increase ,0
www.howdoo.io,user want control over their personal data ,1
www.bitxoxo.exchange,user growth is commendable at 10x growth from 2016 2017 ,1
www.bitxoxo.exchange, this is a very competitive space ,0
www.bitxoxo.exchange, already too many exchanges in play with big players focused on dexs token economics are way off preico price1 xoxo = 1.5 usd price in ico1 xoxo = 2 usd are you serious? ,0
www.bitxoxo.exchange,revisit the token metrics also what is roger ver's involvement here? how active of an advisor is he? his reputation as a scam artist only hurts the project ,0
gramgold.net,use this link to register and buy your tokens,1
vanywhere.com,use of proceeds from the token sale 36% development 35% operations 20% marketing 5% legal 4% contingency,1
ico.charityspace.net,use a gamification to encourge investor join the charity looks interesting ,1
ico.charityspace.net, and beneficiary is 70% higher than charity’s average ,1

www.urunit.io, yes i agree that vision and idea is perfect one because gambling platform needed to be changed ,1
www.urunit.io, that's why i gave score 5 for it ,1
www.urunit.io, team done kyc ,1
www.urunit.io, good sign ,1
www.urunit.io, jurisdiction is based in singapore also very good for investors ,1
www.urunit.io, so in general interesting project to pay close attention to ,1
www.uranus.io,uranus offers a product that has a slight advantage over the current solutions available on the market ,1
www.uranus.io, on the other hand their roadmap and business model are very vague hence it is difficult to judge the team’s business expertise and probability of the product to commercially succeed ,0
www.uranus.io, uranus is backed by a strong team who has real experience working in cloud computing and are full time involved in uranus ,1
www.uranus.io, furthermore the advisors are also impressive and they can potentially help uranus with securing partnerships and accelerating the development as a whole ,1
www.uranus.io, the idea of fog computing along with cloud computing is nothing novel but it still needs to be developed more in order to disrupt current solutions ,0
www.uranus.io, i believe this project has potential to do well in the long ,1
www.uranus.io, run however that will be only if the team showcases and implements tremendous efforts ,0
verime.mobi,upon successful reconciliation of your contribution we will be sending receipt to you via email confirming vme tokens allotted to you,1

ellcrys.org, but the team doesn’t deserve it ,0
ellcrys.org, the entities they have covered with the wp is appreciated but prototype has nothing ,0
ellcrys.org,at least some one responded on the ico bench defending ratings only ,1
ellcrys.org, they just mentioned what they are doing or they have done in terms of hardwork comparing other successful icos/ieos ,1
ellcrys.org, no milestones are defined or achieved as of yet in terms of practicality ,0
ellcrys.org, more hard work needed ,0
bunnytoken.com,updates rating pornstar as an advisor??? !!! no product nothing ,0

stormx.io,updated! thank you!,1
qlink.mobi,updated! i'm sorry,1
www.greenlink.io,updated: the team reached out and further explained their goals ,1
www.greenlink.io, they will not be tracking clothing to the source rather working with certified bodies that will issue a tag of verification ,1
www.greenlink.io, the supply chain space is getting a bit crowded ,0
www.greenlink.io, idea is good ,1
www.greenlink.io, but as an investor i can’t see people caring enough to track their shirt material to the source ,0
www.greenlink.io, yes that’s cool that you want to do the due dillegence but i think companies like whole foods and patagonia are branded well enough where people get that good” feeling from shopping there already confirming that patagonia actually does fair trade or if organic food is actually organic is an extreme like the two mentioned companies this usually comes with additional costs to have pure goods which isn’t something everyone has which tightens the potential customer base ,0
www.greenlink.io, yes the starbucks straw issue is true but people were still drinking their frappuccinos during that time with a small niche of people who are environmentally conscious and even smaller group who understand blockchain i just don’t see it being the next ven or wtc ,0
www.greenlink.io, i’m all for making the world more sustainable so i truly wish you the best ,1
www.agrotechfarm.io,updated: at first the presentation seemed heavily cannabis focused but with automatic cultivation of organic produce this project is capable of solving agricultural difficulties in many parts of the world ,1
viaz.io,updated: 01/23/2019 information of ceo is updated but don't see much information on the profile many funding platform coming now a days so its hard to get place in top ,0
viaz.io, white paper is not more managed team is having only 2 advisors reviewed the mvp it is good platform to use but still i believe they need lot of work to do before process ,0
coinplace.info,updated team brings out a 3 ,1
coinplace.info, young profiles with good ambitions the product is fine even if it is not original at all ,1
coinplace.info, whitepaper lacks of a success record where the team show its experience on icos funding and crypto listings to avoid scam crypto on coinplace ,0
coinplace.info, the vision is ambitious but some basis are lacking,0
sudangoldcoin.com,updated review 9/24/2018 – i appreciate the thoughtful response by the ceo and am updating accordingly 
on vision i will update from 2 to 3 ,1
sudangoldcoin.com, this is not anything against the project just that a gold mining operation is by its very nature a limited opportunity this is not something that can scale quickly like software ,0
sudangoldcoin.com, also updated the product from 2 to 4 – its good to know there is more going on than i read and they are operational ,1
sudangoldcoin.com, good luck to the team ,1

xaya.io, xaya formerly known as chimaera is gaming project with plans to provide a new frontier for gamers and developers within the blockchain community the project aims to offer a decentralized and autonomous gaming platform where developers can build their gaming projects entirely on blockchain technology ,1
xaya.io, the team is pretty diverse and has some good and adequate experience with andrew colosimo andrew gore mike handverger and more ,1

xaya.io, they have 40.5% for sale for the market and aiming to raise funds in different stages of which stage 2 will not take place if stage 1 does not sell out which i like caps for both stages are 4.5m chi and 115m chi at a price of 0.00002 btc roughly $0.14 at this moment ,1
xaya.io, the xaya project was founded in 2016 under the name of chimaera and has slowly been evolving into xaya with the x being the greek letter chi which is the ticker for their coin ,1
xaya.io, they have just launched their mainnet and their wallet which acts as both a vault and game wallet as it has multi wallet functionality ,1
xaya.io, per their roadmap they are aiming to launch the xaya asset trading platform in q1 2019 and in q3 2019 more things are set to launch such as the vr toolkit advanced developer hub and more ,1
xaya.io, however i do not know what more exactly is and what they are striving for after q3 2019 ,0
xaya.io, overall i like the project as there is a lot of opportunity for growth ,1
xaya.io, however i am unsure whether they can attract enough both developers and gamers at the start except for the bounty and airdrop hunters for now to give xaya the start it deserves ,1
xaya.io, adoptation will thus remains to be seen ,0

memority.io, the team behind memority is big ,1
memority.io,but i feel they are lacking experience and connections in the blockchain world ,0
memority.io, the team has presented a nice idea ,1
memority.io,however they are facing established competitors such as storj and sia ,0
memority.io, however according to the memority team they are more advanced as they have a decentralized file restoration system keeping files safe even if you do not use the app for years ,1
memority.io, additionally memority will provide an api for developers so apps can be built on top of the platform with secure storage ,1
memority.io,the team is aiming to go fully live in q1 2019 version 1.0 so that's fairly quick ,1
memority.io,i am staying with my point that the hardcap is ridiculous and nowhere near the 85.5m is needed to build such a system / platform the team can get by with just 5m but would be able to market their product better and get more users hosts and third party developers ,0
memority.io, it remains to be seen whether they can successfully launch memority against the likes of aforementioned competitors ,0
www.datablockchain.io, i think the white paper still needs to confirm the comments from the team as that help explains some of the metrics in the token economics without the clarity in the white paper some potential contributions could just hop it as a project one of the first things i look at are founders/advisors tokens and lockins hard caps without the additional info i would pass on this straight away there is valuable and good info so they should use it,0

www.gigtricks.io,update 30 june: after clarification with amir on a long phone call i am updating my review amir has definitely got the marketing strategy penned down with extensive experience managing huge resources teams and funding successfully ,1
www.gigtricks.io, i am better satisfied with their vision product and commercialisation plans from what i heard but it will be nice to see this on paper which amir said would be updated ,1
www.gigtricks.io, still have some reservations on the technology stack that they have chosen but this is no dealbreaker ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the option to migrate to another platform in the future does exist ,1
www.gigtricks.io, one thing that was highly comforting is the teams strategy in terms of who they are talking to other partners to support easier fiat conversion the right legal authorities etc ,1
www.gigtricks.io, they're putting their heads on the chopping block and willing to do things right ,1
www.gigtricks.io, a few things need to still be figured out but that's expected when utilising new technologies like blockchain they're on the right trajectory ,1
www.gigtricks.io, gigtricks com is already an existing platform for buyers and sellers to do business no vapourware here ,1
www.gigtricks.io, original review: i've reviewed the whitepaper and looked at the team vision is too broad ,0
www.gigtricks.io, trying to do too much with limited info on how the business will be built on the whitepaper: section 14.1 limitations of current ecosystem these are not problems ,1
www.gigtricks.io, just differentiators transparency is not a centralisation issue ,1
www.gigtricks.io, rather it's what info a seller is willing to offer on his public profle seller may choose to not publish their real name if they are also working for another company and not allowed to take on additional jobs ,0
www.gigtricks.io, lack of openness is not a problem ,1
www.gigtricks.io, it's part of the business model ,1
www.gigtricks.io, i do not see any additional benefits offered by gigtricks ,0
www.gigtricks.io,except for the claimed low transaction cost which still needs to be tested when sellers convert tokens to fiat ,1
www.gigtricks.io, 19.2 on gigtricks social sometimes it's better to separate work from pleasure 20.1 authenticated reviews system all platforms offer buyers and sellers to rate each other 24.2 voting pool clever choice of hyperledger fabric ,1
www.gigtricks.io, team: too technical focused ,1
www.gigtricks.io, require business development and more hard marketing skills ,0
www.gigtricks.io, advisors: some questionable members who have been involved in dodgy ico's ,1
www.gigtricks.io, in general: building a new technology platform is easy ,1
www.gigtricks.io, you don't need blockchain to solve the problems in the current ecosystem primarily being high commission fees i think the team knows this ,0
www.gigtricks.io,only 5% of funds collected are going towards both bounty and marketing ,0
www.gigtricks.io, a lot of business development and marketing is required to attract freelancers and buyers to the platform ,0
www.gigtricks.io, majority of the effort should be spent there rather than building a complex technology stack with a weak business case exactly how they offer low transaction costs for the end user and maintain their infrastructure plus have funds to grow the business is not shown ,0
ico.basisneuro.com,update 17 june 2018: in brief false information were found within this project with evidence in its whitepaper and telegram verification ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, i've originally rated this ico 2 5 3 but after some relentless harassment from the ceo who instead of clarifying the red flags that i've raised choose to make baseless allegations+accusations and thus i've changed their rating to 1 1 1 mainly for providing false information in their whitepaper refer to c6 below for a quick summary ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, details with detailed evidence below: first review on 29 march 2018 1 the official telegram group for basisneuro is and has a reasonable no of members 2399 as of this review and is expected to increase further 2 basisneuro team of advisors is more extensive within their main website than within icobench the basisneuro admin may want to add the names of the other advisors here so that icobench reviewers do not jump to the conclusion based on just the limited info within icobench itself ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, 3 one key competitive advantage that basisneuro claimed to have is its patented technology as indicated in its faq do you have a patents? the answer is yes in ten years of operation of the basis neuro laboratory significant discoveries in the field of neuro technologies were obtained which is confirmed by dozens of publications in international scientific paper the list of patents and key publications is presented in whitepaper i've probed further with the team within its telegram group and understand that and is consistent with pg 52 of its wp that the team claim to have 1 patent and 7 software registration i was able to locate for the cited russian patent application no 2009133005/14 titled a method for classification of electroencephalographic signals in the brain computer interface vladimirsky b m vladimirsky b b kan m n shepelev i e owned by the russian federation represented by the ministry of education and science of the russian federation ru the federal state autonomous educational institution of higher professional education southern federal university ru and not basisneuro source: it is unclear if this patent is granted,0
ico.basisneuro.com, but i was informed that shepelev i e is part of the basisneuro team i did a further patent search in the orbit com patent database and was not able to locate for any patent under basis neuro or basisneuro ,0
ico.basisneuro.com,but i understand from the team in telegram that they are working on filing their own patent applications in the future ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, 4 it is unclear if the patent is currently owned by basis neuro or is still under the ownership of the russian university ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, 5 the inventor shepelev i e is visibly missing from the basisneuro telegram group ,0
ico.basisneuro.com,i have left a message in their telegram group stating that igor being part of the team is definitely great due his relevant background ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, do encourage igor to be part of the telegram team as he would certainly be able to aid your fund raising i may revise my ratings after receiving answers to my above questions i will also revise the team rating once the same inventor igor has joined in their telegram group ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, **** nik sviridov ico team member replied on 7 jun 2018 you are an advisor of scammers so i'm surprised at your ratings could you explain what's going on? **** reply to nik on 16 june 2018 : 1 for the record my ratings for neurogress prior to them appointing me as their innovation advisor was similar something which you probably don't care to basis neuro ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, 2 what's better than a continued due diligence from the inside? for neurogress once i'm in the inner team i got to interact with their cto aleksandr and also the tech team to priortise on the technology towards a product ceo konstantin was interestingly missing from all our discussion and meetings and as it turns out there was a fall out within the team leading to the cancellation of the ico as well 
ico.basisneuro.com, as subsequent refunds the latest for neurogress is where the aleksandr has formed a separate telegram group attempting to continue the project via private funding instead of the ico path ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, 3 nik perhaps instead of trying to change the topic you or any of it's core team should be spending time answering my questions arising from my due diligence on your ico which for the record when i raised various questions including uncomfortable questions to the neurogress team they promptly replied me back then ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, 4 as for neuro basis's shepelev i e one person by the name of igor sherpelev eventually joined the telegram group and wrote to me requesting that i change my ratings in icobench since he has managed to reached me via telegram as per my request my reply to igor was: sounds like you don't understand how verification works you shld be aware that anybody can create a telegram user account and use whomever name they wish eg i can rename my account as bill gates and use his photo to put it in a manner that you might understand i'm verifying if you are who you claim you are and the fact that you are very reluctant to verify your identity using igor's official emails does imply to me that you might not be him after all however his response was more to distract me with his opinion on neurogress instead of confirming that he is the same igor from sfu by sending me an email from his sfu account ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, 5 as of 16 june 2018 neither nor igor shepelev is in the basis neuro telegram group interacting with the community ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, 6 fyi if igor has contacted me using his sfu email address your rating would be the same or higher than that of neurogress but if the responses from the team is continued distraction and excuses so be it as part of full disclosure you may noticed my hint to them that muse is not a good input device and the product rating was not upgraded as there was no publications by the team members this was my ratings for neurogress before and after being neurogress's innovation advisor : first reviewed on 11 feb 2018,0
ico.basisneuro.com,1 researchers worldwide have been tackling brain computer interface for more than 2 decades with limited success 2 the addition of robotics into bci is an added complexity 4 a good article on the state of the art in this are is 5 ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, i have asked the team to share with me relevant publications either directly related or indirectly related to their product but received none perhaps the team is currently overwhelmed with their ico campaign will wait for your response and i'll revise my rating accordingly ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, 6 i understand the frustrations involved in fund raising via seed and series a rounds and why you have taking the ico/blockchain route ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, 7 i can see potential neurogress related inventions that are patentable an option that the team may consider pursuing ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, 8 best wishes ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, update 12 feb 2018 : the team has responded to be in the telegram group and will be sharing a portion of their source code for inspection to some of us i would have change my team score from 3.0 to 3.5 but icobench score type is integer rather than floating point ,1
ico.basisneuro.com, update 15 mar 2018 : as part of full disclosure after various in depth communication with the team members i was roped in as an innovation advisor to help in the fulfillment of nrg's vision i'll also be integrating nrg works with the patented ip blockchain after the tge i'll also leave my rating as it is ie no change from 12 feb 2018 **** nik sviridov ico team member replied on 16 jun 2018: you are an adviser to scammers it is your advice that probably caused the neurogress to steal money from people i think your ratings are affiliated you get paid for this no honesty and cleanliness ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, details of your deception can be found here: t me/neurogress **** 2nd reply to nik on 16 june 2018 : c1 three false allegations made by nik ceo of neuro basis that it was my advice that probably caused the neurogress to steal money from people i where is your proof regarding my advice ii where is your proof that neurogress stole money from people and iii where is your proof that it's my advice that casued neurogressto steal money from people?,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c2 fourth false allegation by nik that i think your ratings are affiliated you get paid for this i was not paid to do all my reviews within icobench ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c3 regarding the claim of no honesty and cleanliness i'll leave it to the public to judge my actions and your actions ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c4 fifth false allegation by nik that details of your deception can be found here: t me/neurogress show us the proof ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c5 as a ceo of neuro basis instead of clarifying various red flags that i've raised about neuro basis the ceo use distraction tactic and made various baseless allegations ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c6 after more than 2.5 months later the ceo and team choose to avoid explaining the red flags that i've highlighted in my 29 march 2018 review on their project namely: i patent owned by the russian federation represented by the ministry of education and science of the russian federation and not owned by basis neuro ii fake igor shepelev as confirmed in my conversation with someone who claimed to be him see full chat transcript between and myself: basisneuro htm ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c7 due to the false information that were found to be within the neuro basis whitepaper i am now revising my rating for neuro basis to 1 1 1 ,0
ico.basisneuro.com,c8 those planning to buy neuro basis tokens may wish to verify my due diligence pointers and decide for yourself if i'm lying or telling the truth ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c9 the truth will prevail **** nik sviridov ico team member replied on 16 jun 2018 you are an advisor of competitors neurogress scammers they stole money we paid you for our low rating maybe together with them you stole money from investors nothing surprising details of fraud can be seen here: t me/neurogress * 2 times **** 3rd reply to nik on 16 june 2018 : c10 sixth and ridiculous allegation with zero proof we paid you for our low rating ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, c11 seventh allegation with zero proof maybe together with them you stole money from investors **** nik sviridov ico team member replied on 20 jun 2018 you are an adviser to competitors your assessment of the prohibition of the rules of the icobench because you get paid for promoting your project and for negative feedback about other projects ,0
ico.basisneuro.com, **** 4th reply to nik 22 june 2018 c12 i am currently no longer an innovation advisor to neurogress and icobench accepted that c13 icobench has directly reached out to me to clarify my comments and they have accepted my explanation regarding how i've rated basis neuro as well as acknowledge the red flags that i've raised my advice to basis neuro is to clear the red flags rather than use diversion strategy to avoid addressing the red flags which red flags search for c6 within my lengthy review here ,0
www.cryptassist.io,update 13th of january 2019: seems more and more likely this was a scam all along cryptassist aspires to become the leading web and mobile based application on which users will be able to access all the necessary information required to stay up to date with everything in the cryptosphere gathered and presented on one easy to use the platform first off the financial details: hard cap: $236.25m soft cap: $36.98m with 12% going to the team that's a lot of money additionally i cannot find an outline why they need to raise so much money for a platform promising to supply everyone with unfettered access to the world of crypto assets through an array of 25 essential tools with everything from trading and news alerts to an otc exchange and even a debit card ,0
www.cryptassist.io, i get that money is needed to tackle every part they want to tackle but why so much according to a teammember the team of cryptassist is going to implement an advanced deflation model this means that the coin supply of 10.2 billion should decrease quickly and the value of cta has great potential to rise so why not just start with a lower amount of tokens? because of their mentioned deflation model they are promising a growing coin value in comparison to pre ico prices which is one red flag for me ,0
www.cryptassist.io, however i cannot find any additional details as of yet on their proposed deflation model besides we will burn coins used for services ,0
www.cryptassist.io, how much will be burned what proportion in total will this be pro rate exponential decreasing over time etc ,0
www.cryptassist.io, the team is promising solutions for a lot of things in a short amount of time but their whitepaper only mentions problems and no outlines on how they will deliver the solutions ,0
www.cryptassist.io, lots of projects promised debit cards for cryptocurrencies but there are still almost zero to none out there ,0
www.cryptassist.io, so would like to know how cryptassist will be able to do this due the regulatory framework needed ,0
www.cryptassist.io, i am afraid the team is overpromising and overextending the areas they want to tackle why do we need another ar game another messaging app another exchange and why would we need cta for this instead of the more established competitors for these fields to me it seems that for e g data cryptassist just uses other sites for news and data so how does this add anything new? ,0
www.cryptassist.io, i see a lot of team members but all are pretty new linkedin profiles or are either from other companies only a couple really saying they work for cryptassist so how dedicated is the team actually? full technical team is from mobiloitte that's nice but what will happen if they move on? lots of well known ico bench advisors whether that is a good thing i'll leave in the middle ,0
www.cryptassist.io, but am curious what they all exactly will add lastly i do not like the fact the team is luring people in by giving contributors a chance of winning a tesla roadster if they contribute more than $250 ,0
www.cryptassist.io,however i do like the fact they are giving away 2% of the ico to international ocean conservation and reforestation non profit organizations ,1
www.cryptassist.io,cryptassist is promising a lot and probably too much without any good outlines or reasoning behind their product ,0
www.silkchain.io,upd was: i saw a good big team at first glance ,1
www.silkchain.io,but when i went to check their profiles many didn't mention the project at all or the accounts were created just recently many have too few people and questions regarding working experience ,0
www.silkchain.io, i also did not see the mvp minimal viable product ,0
www.silkchain.io, and the soft cap is too big and this is a risk for investors ,0
www.silkchain.io, do you really need $55 million for the minimum functioning of the project? i don't really believe in it ,0

qilimanjaro.io,until the start of the token sale ,1
jtr-mart.org,until june 9 we have bonuses when buying tokens worth more than $ 500 a bonus of 5% when buying tokens worth more than $ 1000 10% bonus ,1
www.mozocoin.io,unsold tokens are distributed to all mozo holders proportionally ,1
token.breadapp.com,unlike many icos bread already has a product one that has been around since 2014 and is now the bitcoin wallet on iphone ,1
token.breadapp.com, the ico is/was about raising funds to market the app and build the utility of the bread app/platform bread is simply an easy to use mobile based wallet which is going to handle multiple coins btc now eth/erc20 soon ,1
token.breadapp.com, however the secret sauce is leveraging a large user base over 1 million users now to drive demand for bread based access to icos special deals ,1
token.breadapp.com, like discounts and rewards programs for bread based purchases this they believe will encourage people to buy bread tokens vs just buying things with btc and eth as of writing post ico they are starting to roll out eth and erc20 support and begin marketing ,1
token.breadapp.com, i think there will be increased interest in bread ,1
token.breadapp.com, sure it will be one of the many players in this space but they have a strong existing user base and are already integrating with 3rd parties like kraken for services buying crypto ,1
token.breadapp.com, as service that doesn't actually hold users funds they are well placed to expand globally without many regulatory impediments unlike centralized services like coinbase ,1
token.breadapp.com, i see coinbase and others being relegated to service fiat gateways or anchors as stellar calls them and no longer actually holding funds which is completely as it should be ,1
token.breadapp.com, the team is small 12? but planning to grow and the all have solid app development and some with experience from related companies like kraken and coinbase ,1
apollodae.io,unk sale hasn't started,0
unitalent.io,unitalent is working on a perfect use case for blockchain and smart contract technology: elimination of middle men and the trust issue for the freelance industry ,1
unitalent.io, the team’s vast experience in this industry is a big advantage with respect to competing platforms as proven by the high number of prestigious industry endorsers they can boast ,1
unitalent.io, having a platform already in development before the ico is another great argument for this project ,1
socialpolis.io,unique token!! a financially important and socially fair token!,1
tokensale.ponderapp.co,unique take on an online dating platform ,1
tokensale.ponderapp.co, however i don't think a blockchain is necessary to make this a success as commercially it is an interesting product that people could get on board with regardless of the monetary incentive as a person is probably most likely to accept a referral from a friend whom already has vested interest in referring someone to you without the need of an incentive ,0
www.coinjanitor.io,unique project ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, nice community spin ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, vision / product pro’s: there does seem to be real potential here to focus the energy that has already been expended on these projects from multiple development teams and communities ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, there are multiple avenues to extract the value here from acquiring the intellectual property of these failed efforts reviving worthwhile efforts that may have failed due to lack of execution or at minimum focusing the attention of the abandoned community on new efforts ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, i like that there is a clear need for the bridge token in this use case ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, facets to explore: chasing the low end market of coins with a market cap of < $50k would tend to suggest a lower value of assets associated with the coin there is a risk of collecting the land of misfit tokens that could be difficult to extract the value out of ,0
www.coinjanitor.io, the target market at least well covered in the white paper ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, cash flow projections for year one seem conservative to low having to carry this level of management team ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, the fund raising level respective to this cashflow plan also seems to be very dependent on the value increase of the cryptocurrency market as a whole specifically relative to btc and eth in a flat to down scenario for btc and eth this project would require another ico round or a significantly reduced budget for opex and asset acquisition ,0
www.coinjanitor.io, team pro’s: very experienced team ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, ceo has a long and complimentary history of relationships in the industry ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, team has a diverse set of skills and business experience that can be leveraged for different aspects necessary to make this business successful ,1
www.coinjanitor.io, facets to explore: most of the executive team has multiple companies they are actively involved with which is concerning regarding their ability to focus ,0
www.coinjanitor.io, i’d like to see a plan of commitment to the project from the management team post ico and how they plan to manage the other commitments ,0

nafen.co,unfortunately usa citizens is restricted to participate in nafen ico,0
bithemoth.com,unfortunately the team does not meet the goals of the project ,0
bithemoth.com, there isn't information about the team members or the experience does not correspond to the positions ,0
bithemoth.com, this is a big minus ,0
bithemoth.com, it isn't clear from white paper how the project will earn and why its product is better than its competitors ,0
bithemoth.com, it would be good to attach a financial model ,0
bithemoth.com, the project has no mvp ,0
bithemoth.com, there are beginning to be to many exchanges with low volumes ,0

bbiller.com,unfortunately it is a good project but yes small team i can say that they deserve a chance cause their software is already working and they are located in australia ,1
bbiller.com,though the money needed is really exaggerated a little also the amount of tokens issued should be reduced ,0
bbiller.com, stephen rowlison was one of the first to launch a bitcoin debit card in 2014 but it did not work well due to unknown reasons but i think he is a brilliant business man and he can dedicate time and effort to make his projects successful ,1
bbiller.com, hopefully he will redesign the whole ico to be suitable for investors ,1
bbiller.com, the product is really something valuable ,1
bbiller.com,but other parts of the project should be worked on ,0
bithemoth.com,unfortunately i have to agree with the general sentiment here about the team not being experienced enough to handle the implementation of a project on this scale ,1
bithemoth.com, running an exchange is no walk in the park and there are many complexities that need to be taken into consideration ,0
bithemoth.com, apart from the team being inexperienced i also notice that they don't have any advisors on board that could help steer them in the right direction ,0
onlinegamecoin.com,unfortunately after reviewing twice i still had to rate this project the way i did,0 
onlinegamecoin.com, the team vision and product speak for itself from the very basic grammar mistakes throughout promises to investors alone raises red flags etc many more ,0

www.quantocoin.io, identification technology which complies with the regulation of anti money laundering and know your client provisions according to 6.1.3 the inner value of qtc depends on the success of the ico which is quite tautological unclear how and why quantocoin should have superior liquidity compared to other altcurrencies ,0
www.quantocoin.io, the wp goes on describing benefits of nfc and beacon market ? using this as a proxy for the value of quantocoin quantocoin uses cases are same as any normal other currencies users have no rights to cash flows royalties no point in it as an investment nor as a currency ,0

aidus.io,top aidus events of december [must read],1
moneytoken.com,top 10 of projects 2018 ,1
moneytoken.com, i look forward to the product the all star team with top advisors ,1
moneytoken.com, the idea is not new but in the hands of a good team the project has a great chance of success ,1
africunia.com,too many reg flags in this project,0
buzcoin.io,too unreal project ,0
buzcoin.io, why is the hard cap huge so much? what kind of plan is based on? this project should be considered an exception ,0
buzcoin.io, i do not recommend investing in this project ,0
www.sgat-technologies.com,too much theory in the wp ,0
www.sgat-technologies.com, almost half of it is a lecture about blockchain technology itself ,0
www.sgat-technologies.com, but what about your project? competitive analysis? project business planning? what is unique in your solution? i could not see the mvp as the link is locked with the password ,0
www.sgat-technologies.com, i believe the project is badly prepared for the tokensale ps improved for product after the explaination where to find the link ,1
www.sgat-technologies.com, anyway there should be easier access to this,0
www.tokedo.io,too much quotes and white paper look scrimpy ,0
www.tokedo.io, the vision is not something new so i have nothing much to comment there overall some of their features already have an mvp which is a good sign and i do love their token creator the main heart of this project is the decentralize exchange but unfortunately the white paper did not provide any technical workings on the technologies supporting and the architecture of the decentralized exchanges also decentralize exchange lack in speed and liquidity how is tokedo going to overcome such issues ,0
www.tokedo.io, also how is tokedo going to be different from other decentralize exchanges like kyber ,0
www.tokedo.io, i do love decentralize exchanges would there would be great use of them the issues is there are many practical and technical issues that decentralize system would face and thus tokedo would need to have plans to tackle them ,0
www.tokedo.io, as a smaller exchange what strategies do you have to grow your exchange? also you have a token creator the fact is most ico would not want to list on a decentralized exchange due to lack of liquidity unless of cause they cant get it to list on the centralize ones ,0
www.tokedo.io, so how does the token creator link to the exchange ,0
www.tokedo.io, don’t get me wrong i do love the idea ,1
www.tokedo.io, i am very neutral about this project as i am unable to justified if it is bad or if it is good thus i am giving this all to be neutral ,1
www.tokedo.io, i would update to all onces the kyc is passed ,0
www.tokedo.io, team wise good team with good advisors ,1
www.tokedo.io, updated to reflect kyc pass and other relevant questions being answered,1
bunnytoken.com,too much hype too little to back it up their materials like video press releases and other do not offer a viable explanation of their project and how it will operate ,0
bunnytoken.com,they have listed on their website that they have 4.9 rating on ico bench when obviously it is not true,0
bunnytoken.com, this makes me highly skeptical of their ''amount raised'' bar ,0
bithemoth.com,too much going on here ,1
bithemoth.com, it's my experience that young entrepreneurs that try to do too much end up doing a lot of things sub par rather than one thing great you are trying to tackle too much all of which have projects that are focusing on one of the six proposals you put forward ,0
bithemoth.com, the linkedin link for the ceo is dead ,0
bithemoth.com, not good ,0
bithemoth.com, whitepaper is decent ,1
zper.io,too much competition ,0
www.otppay.io,too many words and not a word about what the product will be different from a huge number of similar ones ,0
www.otppay.io, only the proposal to lend 2 5x amount of monthly sales to merchants attracts attention but this is unlikely to be sufficient to compete effectively ,0
onlinegamecoin.com,too many red flags ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, might be misleading investors with unreasonable and unethical promises ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, also grammar mistakes and the short outlook on milestones which makes this a weak project ,0
bankera.com,too many red flag on this project ,0
nauticus.io,too many icobench expert advisors which are involved with too many projects don't think they can add much in the end ,0
nauticus.io, bryan jonathan and hong do have a pretty good background experience in the business world ,1
nauticus.io, the team is raising a lot of money and i am unsure whether they will raise enough money to accomplish everything they want to do ,0
nauticus.io, they are registered with the australian regulator austrac and are planning to launch mid august which is a very good thing for the project! the overall roadmap is very stretched up to 2023 and a lot can and will happen in the mean time i am unsure whether nauticus will be the solution by then to take on everything they are planning to competitors keep on improving and moving forward so it remains to be seen whether nauticus will have gained enough traction ,0
www.bitlumens.com,too many ico advisors just do hit and run scores and it's not fair to ico founders who work hard to build product not to know what 'experts' find wrong with it it's simply lazy ,0
www.bitlumens.com, this is not a new idea i have seen other solar projects aiming to tackle the same problems see 's elegant solution ,0
www.bitlumens.com, but it's a great idea ,1
www.bitlumens.com, i would say one of the main problems other 'experts' might have with this is the messy team layout ,0
www.bitlumens.com, it looks like you have two core team members and a ton of advisors in two different sections clean it up ,0
www.bitlumens.com, the whitepaper link provided here is stuck on ,0
www.bitlumens.com, loading so can't be seen ,0
www.bitlumens.com, that's not good either ,0
www.bitlumens.com, i had to go to your website to find the whitepaper you are not making it easy ,0
www.bitlumens.com, whitepaper is a little thin ,0
www.bitlumens.com, but acceptable ,1
www.bitlumens.com, team looks great in whitepaper ,1
www.bitlumens.com, should be organised here ,0
www.bitlumens.com, video is solid ,1
www.tokenpay.com,too many competitors in this area ,0
www.belotto.io,too many competitions right now in this industry ,0
www.belotto.io, no mvp is also a huge disadvantage ,0
apex.chinapex.com,too many bullshit but can't do anything this is truly shit coin scam coin concept no token marketing coin price will never come ath price rejected from 6/7 major exchange token code review too bad ,0
potionowl.com,too low rating,0
stabix.online,too little info on the solution they are attempting to propose to solve this issue ,0
stabix.online, fraud secured and assets insure crypto exchange can be something or high value but there is no info on this project to make any conclusions,0
wystoken.org,too little activity,0
www.zilliqa.com,too late,0
tokensale.ponderapp.co,too competitive and dont see niche,0
www.digitizecoin.com,too big of a vision combined with complete lack of proof of market demand or mvp/any kind of product ,0
www.digitizecoin.com, ambitious but lacks proof that they have the ability or reason to succeed ,0
www.digitizecoin.com, there are too many similar projects out there ,0
www.digitizecoin.com, by the rules of business they should not receive the investment they want ,0
tomocoin.io,tomocoin is the best ico in 2018 especially for small investments 500 2500 usd because it is a very promising blockchain infrastructure project and it has these unique features: a one of the first to use proof of authority consensus b neo supports it c testnet is live d ico hard cap only 8.5 million usd e solid team and advisors i especially liked cto’s github ! ,1
familypoints.io,tokensale was moved to march more info on their site,0
p2psf.org,tokens will hit market very soon we have already contacted with modern and secure exchanges keep support team p2psf ,1
nafen.co,tokens will become transferable right after ico we're currently on pre sale stage ,1

aitheon.com,tokens will be unlocked june 16th,1
smartrealty.io,tokens will be sent to mew,1
mycreditchain.org,tokens will be issued after the entire ico period is completed ,1

mycreditchain.org, you can buy the tokens from the profile when the service begins it will be sometime q1 2019 ,1
familypoints.io,tokens will be distributed right after tokensale ,1
mandalaex.com,tokens will be distributed once main sale begins ,1
vutoken.io,tokens now showing on my either wallet,1

redcab.io, you can store it in mew or metamask,1
galaxy-esolutions.com,tokens are distributed immediately during ico,1
proncoin.io,tokens and bonus will be sent to your wallet after ico ends ,1
www.trustlogics.io,tokenomics seem to be weak as the founder share is significant as compared to other peer projects in this space ,0
www.trustlogics.io, this space is highly competitive and team would require a very strong marketing plan to penetrate ,0
www.trustlogics.io, currently too almost every company conducts a background check of the candidate it hires though through a different channel utilization of hyperledger though is interesting and a promising move ,1
www.trustlogics.io,but in my opinion using this solution will still take few years ,0
100tokens.com,tokenomics is good not too sure about the team project is unique and could do well,1 
housecoins.org,tokenizing real world assets i e loans is always a great use case ,1
housecoins.org, however i would like to see the product and the website needs a bit more ,0
housecoins.org, the whitepaper outlines the concept well ,1
housecoins.org, will this be an sto? also the 50% reserve and 30% in crowdsale seems to be a bit top ,0
www.art-pro.io,tokenizing and ensuring the authenticity of art via smart contracts is a viable and highly commercial use case for blockchain technology hoping to see what is more to come ,1
www.art-pro.io, however gaining adoption will definitely be difficult and can make or break a project ,0
www.art-pro.io, a couple other projects are also attempting this hard to tell whybone is more capable than the other !,0
www.crystals.io,tokengo is a very promising project i recommend you promising tasks have been set by the project and some of them have already been implemented during ico ,1
www.crystals.io, now you can still get a piece of the profitable pie and get a bonus within 3 days ,1
www.crystals.io, go to the tokengo platform website and read whitepaper or miniwp at // tokengoplatform com i think you will be interested in the plans of the platform ,1
tokengoplatform.com,tokengo platform of the future the development team really tried because they offer to enter the world of blockchain technologies with them and using the tokengo platform i'm sure they will succeed ,1
tokengoplatform.com,tokengo platform is a quality product for investors and businessmen because it contains many functions and many opportunities ,1
www.ubex.com,tokengo offers a single platform with private offices we fully support the idea of economic incentives as the main instruments ,1
www.ubex.com, they have collected over 5000 eth ,1
orisspace.io,tokengo hold a large scale bounty at a good level of support ,1
orisspace.io, this bounty is fundamentally different from the others she offers to create her own tokens ,1
orisspace.io, they allow investors to significantly reduce the time to reach their liquidity and profitability ,1
immvr.se,token will be released exchanges after the ico you can sell and buy after that ,1
kryll.io,token will be listed in q2 2018,1
www.uhive.com,token value graph page 35 of the wp looks like claiming to be a security token quite unusual practice of conducting ico ,0
www.uhive.com, altogether the whitepaper looks sloppy ,0
www.uhive.com, no business planning or competitive analysis must have! ,0
www.uhive.com, mvp available,1
lydian.io,token that hires paris hilton to push the sales go on giving discounts to sell the the tokens as if it was a pizza deal the founder who has no idea of blockchain and videos full of hard sell marketing you stay away ,0
lydian.io, got blocked by the team when asking basic questions and offensive responses from gurbaksh singh chahal who's supposedly the ceo of gravity4 seems like a vaporware ,0
apollodae.io,token sale will start next month we are making a few changes that should make our sale even better ,1
familypoints.io,token sale is postponed to march 2018,1
www7.universa.io,token received ,1

www.fundfantasy.io, doug fantasy stock markets are actually pretty popular online believe it or not ,1
www.fundfantasy.io, the concept is not ridiculous ,1
www.fundfantasy.io, often people will do fantasy stock trading before spending real money it's great training ,1
kript.io,token can only be bought by either bitcoin or ether right,1
valuecash.com,token are automatically release after purchase ,1
www.zeepin.io,together with the key a crap ico couple of hours wasted trying to participate and unable to see the tokens after repeatedly adding the script hash on the neon wallet recommended on the website ,0
www.zeepin.io, this says it all about the company total crap ,1
envion.org,todays the day of envion's ico! we all have been patiently waiting for it and now its here ,1
envion.org, the demand seems overwhelming with over 120k subscribers to the whitelist and over 13k people in the telegram channel ,1
envion.org, the smart contract for the env security token has been deployed on the ethereum blockchain and everything seems ready now all we've got to do is to wait for 12 utc and prepare ourselves to be one of the lucky ones that manage to get hold of some env tokens ,1
envion.org, i wish luck to everyone participating today and to envion's hardworking team that everything will go smoothly for them on this big day!,1

bbtokens.io,today guys we will teach you how to write a shitty whitepaper and hope for the best🙊😂 ,0
bbtokens.io,big bang ico team is so good at that😭,0
natmin.io,today blockchain technology is used in many areas many international companies are focused on reducing costs and increasing transparency and this project responds to these ideas ,1
natmin.io, i think that when it will be implemented it will make innovations more accessible to a wide range of projects and users ,1
natmin.io, good professional team and promising project,1
tokengoplatform.com,to see a worthy project is very clearly described now a great rarity pay your attention to tokengo ,1
tokengoplatform.com, a certain blockchain platform which will allow to create a certain society to create a huge system due to which other small companies will be able to connect their mobile applications desktop applications to reach their axes,1
foxcsn.com,to many competitors i don't see the innovation,0
entry.money,to know personally tomas ambrazas i simply want to say that it is a honest person and full of good intentions ,1

goo.gl,to buy team tokens please sign up for a personal account: you will get an address for the payment in your personal account you may pay with btc eth ltc bch or neo ,1
somesing.io,to be true i have never seen something similar ,1
somesing.io, the idea is interesting ,1
but what is the reason for implementation blockchain technology in this product ,0
somesing.io,the team is experienced and solid enough ,1
somesing.io, i like advisers and notable partnerships ,1
somesing.io, it would be great if you will find more partnerships in the music industry and collaborate with them during the ico ,1
somesing.io, inflation ecosystem model seems pretty good ,1
somesing.io, but tokenomics is poor ,0
somesing.io, token allocation 10% for sales bonuses is a significant amount that will surely cause a dump ,0
somesing.io, i want to suggest you adding information about lock up terms or vesting for team allocation ,0
somesing.io, for sure korean ico market is completely different from european ico market and maybe you will succeed there ,1
coti.io,to be reviewed soon ,1
buzcoin.io,to be honest this tokensale is awful jsut another fundraising for nothing what makes ico industry stacked in a swamp ,0
buzcoin.io, many good project are made by russin teams and this is just an unpleasant exception ,0
tecracoin.io,to be honest i like this idea ,1
tecracoin.io, it has social significance especially in japan cold weather for scientists is terrible i felt strongly that a platform to support them is needed ,1
tecracoin.io, i hope that such efforts and magnifying glasses will spread to the world ,1
tecracoin.io, i felt graphene white light business plan financial plan very good ,1
tecracoin.io, on the other hand i could not find a detailed description of the following mechanism in the white paper ,0
tecracoin.io, after having a wonderful discussion with the team i made the following discoveries i am looking forward to the arrival of their prototype ,1
tecracoin.io, ==== blockchain gives transparency in allocation of funds each on can check where funds dedicated for science goes on explorer you can check right now that we didn’t spend any tcr on science now and the same is for dividend addresses it build more trust in future we will develop it much more ,1
tecracoin.io, creating global investing platform for investors ,1
www.astoria.ltd,to be honest i don't know exactly my assistant said we should check it before decide to participate in ico your project looks very interesting amongst nearest months offerings,1
www.brikcoin.net,to be frank london and uk is not the place i’m living but i very appreciate the challenge of this team which goes to solve the problem on houseless people all around united kingdom ,1
www.brikcoin.net, i wish to all of us get involved on solving this issue as soon as possible with very smart solutions based on blockchain ,1
www.brikcoin.net, i’m sure this team could do it ,1
www.brikcoin.net, wish them huge success!,1
napoleonx.ai,to all the new people interested in the project you can use the referral code : biowcfcb it's a 5% bonus gain for you and me ,1
threatintelligence.market,tiny team with nobody on it even mentioning this project on their linkedin profile ,0
threatintelligence.market, 20 page whitepaper is brutally hard to read with blue text on blue background and 20pt font ,0
threatintelligence.market, this is a bad punt put a little more effort in you guys come on!,0
timecoinofficial.com,timecoin is a non rewritable standard token based on the waves network it is decentralized and completely anonymous which wants to modernize and evolve payment and exchange methods ,1
timecoinofficial.com, it was born from an idea of two scholars ,1
timecoinofficial.com, it is a new project young and modern ,1
timecoinofficial.com, investing in this cryptocurrency means investing in free time ,1
timecoinofficial.com, it aims to be a financial benefit and a payment method in other stores ,1
timecoinofficial.com, you can buy them with bitcoin ethereum and litecoin timecoin is the fact that the investments,1
robotinaico.com,time to read the whitepaper,1
sharering.network,tim bos the ceo is also the founder of keaz a platform for sharing cars he has experience as a blockchain engineer ,1
sharering.network, rohan lepage the coo can also be considered an expert in the blockchain ecospace ,1
sharering.network, recently the team won 1st place at the blockchain hackathon in vietnam showing off their capabilities and skills in blockchain engineering ,1
sharering.network, the sharering project will face some stiff competition together with the lack of partnerships i feel that market adoption will be hard ,0
sharering.network, additionally i feel the project is trying to raise a lot of money for which they do not have a mvp yet to show ,0
www.uhive.com,ticks a lot of future tech boxes exciting!,1
delta.money,thx friend for your comment ,1
stoxum.org,thx for your feedback tyreece!,1
www.thundercore.com,thundercore: decentralization with the benefits of centralization we need to make a fast summing up to understand thundercore from light paper: the thunder paradigm provides a bridge between the two: it is a fully decentralized method for maintaining a public evm compatible blockchain with the performance of centralized solutions thunder protocol: the thunder protocol combines any standard blockchain which we will refer to as the slow chain—with an optimistic fast path ,1
www.thundercore.com, the fast path protocol is executed by a committee of stake holders and coordinated by a central authority called the accelerator ,1
www.thundercore.com, the accelerator’s job is to linearize transactions and data which is a task that is hard to do in a decentralized way yet easy for a central authority ,1
www.thundercore.com, anyone having stake in our system can put down an escro a so called stake in onto the slow chain and that qualifies the entity to become a committee member next we subselect a committee of 500 nodes among the entities that have put down the stake in both committee members and the accelerator are rewarded for their work in our initial deployment we are relying on ethereum’s blockchain as our underlying slowchain this blockchain currently is based on proof of work but there are ongoing plans to replace it with a proof of stake system in our initial deployment we will also only rely on a single accelerator in later versions we will extend the system to support multiple shards as mentioned our first release will be fully evm compatible to enable direct migration of existing ethereum dapps ,1
www.thundercore.com, thundercore has the purpouse to became fast scalable and secure blockchain thundercore want decentralization not only for payment systems but rather to enable the above features for general applications as for example dapp ,1
www.thundercore.com, i'm quite confused because i dont find some important features as token distribution token economics soft cap hard cap quite strange i hope they add it as soon as possible ,0
www.thundercore.com, team: 5 in website team section show only 3 members but i'm sure they are not alone: ceo chris wang chief scientist elaine shi scientist rafael pass they have a full background it's a pity that not all use linkedin ,0
www.thundercore.com, thundercore is hiring too ,1
www.thundercore.com, vision: 5 thundercore promises a great vision a complete decentralized environment for payment smart contract and dapp product: 4 in first stage thundercore has only one accelerator and this is not too much decentralized friendly it's seems to be a centralized system,0
www.thundercore.com, they also promise in later version to extend system to multiple shards in cryptoworld is a common pratics promise something that it will not be realized when and if it's realized this rate will go to 5 instantly,0
www.thundercore.com,thundercore is an interesting project with ambitions to improve blockchain as a whole ,1
www.thundercore.com, the development for thundercore is currently in the pre release mainnet stage with mainnet planned for q3 2019 ,1
www.thundercore.com, the project is being developed by an impressive team of 60 people mostly based in the san francisco area ,1
www.thundercore.com, especially i would like to highlight elaine shi who is a prominent thought leader in the academic blockchain space ,1
www.thundercore.com, the only concern we have with thundercore is the huge valuation before the launch of the mainnet,0
www.thundercore.com, although we can see a bunch of strategic partners and advisors who have deep connections and substantial experience in the blockchain arena to help thundercore to deliver their plans ,1
ico.luckchemy.com,thumbs up for the great project good luck and i wish you achieve more sucsses ,1
kryptobits.com,through a smart contract connected with the crowdsale website: you can use mew metamask or jaxx to send the eth to the sc address just changing the gas limit and gas price ,1
tokensale.moozicore.com,three members of the team has passed the kyc so thats great news ,1
tokensale.moozicore.com, this project has a solid team to deliver results ,1
tokensale.moozicore.com, vision is also great ,1
tokensale.moozicore.com, the idea of creating personalized social music experience for each customer is a good one ,1
www.casinosinvest.com,three different services on platform using same crypto payment is good for product revenue and inter linking of products alpha test in upcoming month will boost project based on results additionally dividends to invester is also a plus ,1
rhovit.info,thousands of crypto and blockchain startups that launched during the rise of the new world order in the last five years only a few hundred have a product on the market today rhovit came on the scene in 2017 during a period of great interest for investors betting on the cryptocurrencies rise to riches many crypto startups achieved their funding with a whitepaper and a promise so many have failed to deliver rhovit on the other hand didn’t participate in the hype cycle and focused rather on building a product in the pay for view of digital content and time their launch when the value of blockchain has more traction with the investment community and participants see the value ,1
rhovit.info, rhovit separates its self from other content driven incentive platforms by paying both the creator and viewer rhovit is the only incentive platform to pay the content creators in usd rather than crypto for content viewed ,1
rhovit.info, they are a curated site and the primary content comes from gamers bloggers and video producers ,1
rhovit.info, viewers earn rbit token as well as virtual points used to unlock content ,1
rhovit.info, every time a viewer unlocks content they earn what is called loot achieving 20 loot gives the user 1 rbit token which they can use to buy digital goods in rhovit's digital store or move to their nem wallet and sell on cryptocurrency exchanges ,1
rhovit.info, all content purchased is paid for with points content creators keep 100% of the points spent on their content ,1
rhovit.info, points earned on viewed content are in usd—good cold hard cash! how does this compare to other well known content platforms? if you’re a content creator and you posted your content on youtube for example you would have to achieve milestones with the number of subscribers and ad clicks to earn cash this will take some time if you are not a digital expert in growing your community rhovit on the other hand provides instant weekly payouts on content reviewed and rewards the producer earnings sooner without having millions of subscribers ,1
rhovit.info, rhovit is well positioned to content producers who want to see an immediate return on investment for their hard work in the creation and sharing of gameplay blogging videos and coming soon podcasts ,1
rhovit.info, the challenges for rhovit will be to break out of the pack of startups in the same segment like d tube and bitube who focus on a decentralized approach for viewers to earn tokens when they view content ,1
rhovit.info, if rhovit can sign significant distribution content partners in hot segments such as podcasters and gamers this should provide an opportunity to scale on hot trends and break out as a digital distribution and content leader ,1
myidm.io,though the vision is strong but it will be difficult to directly take on the established players in cloud space they already have very strong presence in the market ,0
myidm.io, the working prototype is available ,1
myidm.io,but mass scale adoption will be challenging considering the interest of consumers ,0
myidm.io, the steal is company holds good number of patents in data storage space and execution will be key to success ,0
myidm.io, tokenomics is not in favor of investors and token seems to be quite expensive ,0
bountie.io,though the team looks solid i doubt if they have experience in blockchain technology besides a large user base is needed for this product to be successful which is not easy to develop ,0
bountie.io, all the best!,1
medicohealth.io,though the team is numerous and has a vast industry experience there is not so much blockchain it and fundraising experience ,0
medicohealth.io, this is one more telemedicine project but no competitive analysis available not clear if they understand well how to conduct ico and make business development on blockchain ,0
medicohealth.io, also the wp lacks financial info and literally no business planning numbers,0
www.gigtricks.io,though the market already has similar concepts i believe the team is strong and up to the challenge ,1
www.gigtricks.io, the project is a tokenized freelancing platform which may work without the help of blockchain technology ,0
www.gigtricks.io, i guess we will have to wait and see how this one turns out ,0
www.gigtricks.io, good luck to the gigtricks team ,1
infleum.io,though the ideas are quite fresh they go without proper competitive analysis to similiar solutions no clear business planning in the wp ,0
infleum.io, i did not catch why blockchain is vitally necessary here why ico ,0
infleum.io, the team is too localised so i doubt about international perspectives ,0
tap4.menu,though the idea itself is not so big and innovative there is no doubt that this is one that wants to be commercialized ,1
tap4.menu, the point of concern is that tap4 menu will allow you to pay in your currency ,1
tap4.menu, if pay is tokens only then usability is very bad ,0
tap4.menu, but there is a concern that the demand for tokens will not grow as a result of payment freedom ,0
tap4.menu, the video has a description like burn but it requires a fairly large cost to get a big effect ,0
tillbilly.com,though the idea is not novel and has already been implemented ,0
tillbilly.com,but if they can execute it better than the others they might have a chance ,1
tillbilly.com, team seems ok ,1
whalesburg.com,though the core team is young the vision they have for the platform is certainly innovative ,1
whalesburg.com, mining is only gonna become more and more important as the industry matures and there is a need for improving mining yields and bringing mining to the masses though one major challenge in the mining industry is that it is monopolized by a few big players would love to see how this unfolds,1
whalesburg.com, all the best!,1
www.sntx.io,though it seems just another ieoand just another crypto exchange it has something special ,1
www.sntx.io, the best part is that sentex exchange is already in operating mode and running ,1
www.sntx.io, of course the exchange itself need some adjustments and improvements ,0
www.sntx.io, but it is strong and valid mvp ,1
www.sntx.io, so far tokens lanched by crypto exchange are mostly successful e g binance huobi kucoin etc ,1
www.sntx.io, therefore if the team performs well the token should also have the clear utility case ,1
www.deedcoinlaunch.com,though i like the team it is one more real estate ico ,0
www.deedcoinlaunch.com, where is your competitive analyses? why other real estate icos have arguably not been successful at all? what mistakes you will not copy what advantages you have? i dont see it in the wp,0
www.deedcoinlaunch.com, too concentrated on sec issues but not focused on your pitch,0
www.bidooh.io,though i like the team from industry point of view i don't see enough ico experience here and this is crucial when you go to raise through crypto crowdfunding ,0
www.bidooh.io, it means there is a risk not to raise money ,1
www.bidooh.io, the wp has some hints about tokenomics but they are not supported with numbers ,0
www.bidooh.io, there are no competetive analysis and business planning data there ,0
www.bidooh.io, despite the fact i really like this product as an expert here i judge on possibility to make a successful ico then to get listed and provide potential token price growth for ico contributors and not in general about the project apart from its ico tasks,1
www.coinimp.com,though i find such ideas interesting i am very disappointed with the whitepaper ,0
www.coinimp.com, it is sketchy with little info on 25 pages of big letters and primitive pictures ,0
www.coinimp.com, no competitive analysis no convincing business model etc ,0
www.coinimp.com, no attractive tokenomics! ,0
www.coinimp.com,according to linkedin the ceo runs another three different projects at the same time which is very questionable ,0
www.coinimp.com, the team seems to lack needed experience in fundraising no proper advisors or consultants ,0
www.coinimp.com, 450 days ico? i don’t believe in it,0
imigize.io,though i carefully read quite well done wp especially pages 21 25 i think blockchain/decentralised solution is not necessary here it perhaps could make sense still far ,0
imigize.io, fetched if fitting sizes of footware and clothes of customers change frequently but certainly it is not the real case so it could be a nice it centralised project but why make in on blockchain and make ico? the team could be more international ,0
www.gilgameshplatform.com,though i believe this is not the first product of this kind in the market it's got a clear roadmap and marketing content is absolutely appealing ,1
www.gilgameshplatform.com, plus as i can see a lot of business development for the product has already been done ,1
www.gilgameshplatform.com, the team of 5 causes some doubts as the ambitions seems to be huge and the advisory board is not so big either ,0
www.gilgameshplatform.com, i think the team should work on that ,0
www.avinoc.com,those companies i dedicate the time to provide a review are deserving of the review and rating having said that and before i begin i'll note that igor karavaev should be removed from icobench altogether given his ulterior motives for providing such reviews ,0
www.avinoc.com, we are a community whose altruistic nature and betterment for the ecosystem environment and goal for socioeconomic convergence is paramount which is to say that personal gain should not even be on our radar ,1
www.avinoc.com, your reviews here should not be contingent on a prospective job offer or fee ,0
www.avinoc.com, i've never been nor will i ever accept payment for a review ,0
www.avinoc.com, now let's begin first the team this team has a sufficient amount of experience both in the space and industry to understand the challenges inherent within the supply chain as well as their competition ,1
www.avinoc.com, i've always said that what separates a good company from a great one is its team and this one gets it ,1
www.avinoc.com, next the vision this company has a grand vision but a necessary one the aviation industry is riddled with inefficiencies and i firmly believe that again because of the team that avionic can fulfill its vision and deliver upon its concept ,1
www.avinoc.com, lastly the product understanding the comprehensive nature and the extent to which delivering upon the aforementioned requires a specific level of know how and relevant feasibility ,1
www.avinoc.com, although it will take an abundance of time to disrupt the sector the product will serve society before it serves the bureaucracy of a significant corporation and if i were advocating for a major airline or defense contractor i would suggest they partner with avionic this company has all of the tools required to become a success ,1
www.geeba.io,thoroughly interesting concept and a good use case of blockchain ,1
thorchain.org,thorchain's incentives to liquidity providers node validator's arbitragers and swappers would attract much investors to it ,1
thorchain.org, it's security measures tss implementation and unique governance structure is something much appealing to crypto enthusiast ,1
thorchain.org, thorchain's products weekly dev reports monthly budget reports open source gitlab etc are efforts made by the team to be completely transparent with the community and build trust! 💯,1
www.idacpro.io,thomas guo failed john wilson invited failing the kyc is a serious flag ,0
www.idacpro.io, kyc passed yanru wang ,1
www.idacpro.io, kyc passed ～～～～～～～～ ,1
www.idacpro.io, there are spelling errors in your description of this project ,0
iico.me,this's real bro not scammers ,1
tradershub.io,this would completely solve a huge void in the crypto trading community all i hear are complaints about exchanges and orders and lack of platform the one described in this wp ,0
tradershub.io, i hope its available before scheduled and registering is fast and easy! if you need help in certain areas there are plenty of talented people out there ready to assist ,1
on.live,this would be more feasible if they had a pool of clients that they could move over to the blockchain,1
on.live,as opposed to starting from scratch as adoption will surely be a critical factor to their success ,0
aass.io,this will not be an easy market to disrupt there are a few other projects that have a similar model ,0
aass.io, they have strong team and vision so hopefully they can pull this off,1
cln.colu.com,this will be the only ico im getting into so i hope you guys do well ,1
cln.colu.com, good luck!,1
appcoins.io,this will be compromising phone security and user personal data ,0
appcoins.io, users using appcoin store has to disable security setting on smartphone which is a method to install unauthorised application ios and android recommends users to not install unauthorized application because of security regular application crash and os software updates ,0
appcoins.io, i think most popular mobile apps will not use appcoin platform so game developers and small apps may use this platform ,0
appcoins.io, i am confused how google and apple will react with this business model ,0
aidus.io,this will be a promising and amazing project for cryptocurrency digital world ,1
aidus.io, i do believe that this project will succeed ,1
www.stopthefakes.io,this will be a product with a real use case ,1
www.stopthefakes.io, i see governments to support it and use it in order to fight counterfeit ,1
www.stopthefakes.io, team is legit excellent roadmap with many stages which is a must have for me for any project and the best part for me regarding investing: low total supply and low price ,1
sancoj.com, this week price is 1eth = 850000 sanc and that is 37.5% bonus always make sure you get your information from the official website only,1
hashbon.com,this was a tough one to rate because there's a few conflicting elements if it weren't for a potential probable instance of plagiarism in the white paper i likely would have rated it higher ,0
hashbon.com, first of all the idea for a multiblockchain framework for business and enterprise customers makes sense and the game plan has potential ,1
hashbon.com, i also like that the team behind it has allegedly built and released some applicable software constructs in the blockchain space that modes well for the feasibility of the project actually reaching fruition ,1
hashbon.com, the pricing of the token for the ico and the hard/soft caps are all reasonable which rates favorably for me as well ,1
hashbon.com, what is a huge strike against the project for me though is the fact that an entire section of the white paper seems to be plagiarized from other documents to me that's a sign of either laziness or worse malice neither of which is a good thing for building trust within a project ,0
hashbon.com, it's things like this that foster doubt of whether or not the team behind it actually built the software they claim to have produced and whether or not they are actually capable of developing this framework ,0
hashbon.com, i reached out to the team on the 24th seeking clarity on the white paper and reserve the right to update my review/score pending the response for reference the white paper section of merit is titled 'a common platform for communication between the company and its shareholders' and these are two of the source papers where the information was copied from: corporate governance commentary: harvard law school forum:,0
Neuromation.io,this waiting is painful ,0
suapp.org,this token will make youths all around the world especially africa to earn as they learn ,1
ico.beyondseenscreen.com,this token serves no purpose ,0
ico.beyondseenscreen.com, you could use eth to do this if you really needed to ,0
ico.beyondseenscreen.com, plus this idea does not need the blockchain at all ,0
ico.beyondseenscreen.com, shazam does this for music and they do not need the blockchain ,0
ico.beyondseenscreen.com, there is a reason why so many other projects have come and gone in this space sorry guys but this just likes a fund raising exercise ,0
mobacoin.tech,this token is an excellent category of modern exchange tokens ,1
mobacoin.tech, good team members are participating ,1
mobacoin.tech, also i think that the use of tokens and the balance between tokens are the best ,1
www.perlin.net,this time i am higher than the ico bench rate sometimes it happens ,1
www.perlin.net, great team project i like particulary because of the core business and the ecosystem ,1
www.perlin.net, please aware of the community traction and adoption in and out i wish you the best ,1
www.perlin.net, please fix the kyc as soon as possible,0
tse.bitnation.co,this thing looking good ,1
tse.bitnation.co, will keep an eye on this,1
www.satt-token.com,this team is very powerful ,1
www.satt-token.com, i think that they have professional and high quality know how ,1
www.satt-token.com, we understand the problems in the current industry accurately and incorporate measures to improve them ,1
www.satt-token.com, i think that it is a necessary project to make the advertising industry better ,1
cubomania.io,this team is thinking three steps ahead ,1
cubomania.io, great vision ,1
cubomania.io, product is content driven and makes an overwhelming adoption seamless and simple ,1
cubomania.io, the team has no corporate longevity ,0
cubomania.io, but the skills and learning capabilities are there ,1
i-chain.net,this team is experienced and already has mvp ,1
i-chain.net, however the field of insurance using block chains is becoming a fierce battle zone ,0
signals.network,this space is getting crowded quickly and the are not adding anything new and unique ,0
ico.loanbit.org,this space is getting a bit crowded but there will be sufficient demand for lending to handle multiple players in this space ,1
ico.loanbit.org, the concept is good for two segments of the market hodlers and when you are in a bull market ,1
ico.loanbit.org, for someone with a short term swing trading view this would not work i tested this out on another platform i took out a loan with 0.2 eth $200 and paid it back in 4 days because the market was going down at the time i was concerned that my $200 would be worth less by the time i paid my loan off ,0
ico.loanbit.org, i would like to see a working prototype or an mvp ,1
ico.loanbit.org, the team looks capable and they have a strong advisory team ,1
nash.io,this should be rated 'very high' really ,1
nash.io, i did not get in the lottery but this will be as big as icon if not bigger ,1
www.beercoin.codes,this seems like a quirky and fun project ,1
www.beercoin.codes, it puts crypto in the hands of people who might otherwise not come into contact with it directly ,1
www.beercoin.codes, i think it could really catch on in certain regions ,1
www.beercoin.codes, aiming for a stable coin is one of the hardest things to achieve so that might become an issue in the long run ,0
www.beercoin.codes, team could use a bit strengthening as well especially in the marketing department ,0
www.beercoin.codes, it will take some effort to get breweries and bars onboard with this idea ,0
www.cryptomarketads.com, after getting message from oleg martinuk ico team crypto market ads i revised my rating from 4/4/3 to 4/5/5 thanks for the clearification,1
www.zichain.io,this project bring the dream service come true if the mentioned already get license is true ,1
www.zichain.io, the introduction video is very simple and clear so investor can get the point in minutes ,1
www.zichain.io, but white paper is too simple and lack of some important information especially the technology team marketing plan and financial outlook infomation need to provide at wp ,0
xriba.com,this project address the needs in most of ico cosystem especially from investor point of view ,1
xriba.com, although blockchain is transparency however the using of fund is not ,0
xriba.com, the beta product is online i have confidence on the project team can perform as they planned ,1
www.satt-token.com,this seem to be a solid project with a working mvp and a dedicated team ,1
www.satt-token.com, a layer of trust is also added by the fact that they have passed their kyc ,1
www.satt-token.com, good luck with the ico!,1
xtribe.io,this reverse ico project has made many users who have downloaded and used the app as a geomarketplace app xtribe connects users in their area allowing them to sell or purchase all different types of goods and services these users can browse the pictures and descriptions of everything being offered locally and even contact sellers for more information through the app communicate securely and effectively without the interference of a third party ,1
www.ubex.com,this research shows all the truth about ubex,1
tokensale.bitscreener.com,this rating was based on the information available at the time of the evaluation ,1
www.modex.tech,this rating is done on request from the team the team and vision look strong with some gaps that could be relatively easily solved with the addition of key skills especially in the tech space ,0
www.modex.tech, product has become paramount and not having an mvp ,0
although the prior development work looks sound might hamper a successful raise as well as the hardcap which looks very aggressive ,0
www.modex.tech, conceptually i like it and i hoe it succeeds ,1
quant.network,this projets looks good : great team and idea ,1
quant.network, look forward to see the mvp ,1
expand.org,this project's token metrics are a joke ,0
expand.org, i also wouldn't have much confidence in a project where the guy's girlfriend is a main part of the team ,0
expand.org, it's getting dumped hard right now,0
viewchain.org,this project will use the elastos blockchain and will be one of the strongest dapps so far ,1
viewchain.org, i totally recommend it ,1
www.zetaspace.io,this project will solve the problems of existing blockchain platforms ,1
www.zetaspace.io, blockchain is a great technology,1
www.zetaspace.io, but it's still a challenge ,0
www.zetaspace.io, their project will solve that problem and advance the blockchain ,1
perlin.net,this project will have a very high rating,1
ndexnetwork.com,this project will give a good opportunity to crypto investors to cash out their crypto earnings ,1
ndexnetwork.com, good work ,1
ndexnetwork.com, keep it up ,1
profede.com,this project will face some challenges the protocol will need more blockchain developers to get this to a working mvp ,0
incremint.io,this project will be very useful me as cryptotrader,1
medicalchain.com,this project was a great idea and vision,1
medicalchain.com,the team was not able to execute and get it to work ! what exactly happened is unknown ! ,0
blockchain.io,this project ticks all the right boxes ,1
blockchain.io, great mvp good marketing strong team and complete whitepaper ,1
blockchain.io, hard cap seems a bit on the high side but apart from that this seems like a great project,1
onlinegamecoin.com,this project sounds more like the chance for this token to gain some value is less than winning the lottery,0
onlinegamecoin.com, fancy terms like ai and online gaming mixed with no reason whatsoever ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, i do not think this is a good idea,0
angrytoken.com,this project sounds interesting!! i like the idea of it,1
aeropoisk.ru,this project should be updated it seem dead on icobench 1 ,0
aeropoisk.ru, no team members 2 ,0
aeropoisk.ru, obviously no team listed 3 ,0
aeropoisk.ru, no timeline 4 ,0
aeropoisk.ru, no mvp maybe the team should update their profile and i would be happy to reconsider my rating,1
www.hilarium.org.sg,this project seems very promising ,1
disciplina.io,this project seems to be so reassuring,1
galion.io,this project provides a true use case in cryptocurrency that is the lack of global user interface to manage different crypto assets ,1
galion.io, i like the vision of the team to provide a tool for both fiat and crypto assets ,1
galion.io, they already have secured promising partnerships kyber network for instance .1
galion.io, mvp is already live which is a good plus for this kind of project ,1
galion.io, the team is skillfull and seem to have the skills to execute their vision ,1
galion.io, impressive board of advisors team members from wepower kyber network ,1
www.nahmii.io,this project promising to be a great upgrade of blockchain as is for sure blockchain scaling is the big issue and nahmii as a revolutionary layer2 ethereum based protocol provides unrivaled throughput low latency instant finality and predictable fees ,1
www.nahmii.io, it already working product which brings raw scaling power for mature blockchains nowadays ,1
allforcrypto.org,this project plans to build a crypto based alternative to ebay ,1
allforcrypto.org, they already have an mvp in place which looks really good i just played around with it so a 5 rating for the product ,1
allforcrypto.org, their vision is not quite original as many have already tried to implement such a platform however their mindset is different and they seem to be determined to bring a really good product on the market ,1
allforcrypto.org, because of their different mindset that seems in place i am giving them a 5 on vision as well ,1
allforcrypto.org, as for the team the project is still in its early stages and have 10 team members this seems to be the only drawback of the project and i highly recommend you guys to add more team members and advisors to properly develop this project ,0
allforcrypto.org, the good part is that they passed the kyc and 5 out of 10 team members have an ico success score on ico bench so this is a really good sign ,1
allforcrypto.org, however because of the reduce team member number even though they managed to pull out an mvp i will give a rating of 3 ,1
allforcrypto.org, overall this seems a promising project ,1
allforcrypto.org, i wish you all good luck!,1
blockchain.io,this project of an already completed exchange ,1
blockchain.io, team members are completed and can be relieved ,1
blockchain.io, but this white paper is strange ,0
blockchain.io, besides coldwallet's security no concrete solution is presented ,0
blockchain.io, the hard cap is too large and its basis is not shown ,1
blockchain.io, also there is no description showing the allocation of procurement amounts ,0
blockchain.io, from the presence of presentation materials and dentsu this project seems to expect a big market in japan ,1
blockchain.io, but now the japanese financial services agency is strengthening regulations on exchanges it is unclear whether this vision will work ,0
blockchain.io, although some success can be expected explosive growth can not be expected ,1
blockchain.io, i did discussion with the team and i improved my evaluation because the team's material was actually improved ,1
onlinegamecoin.com,this project needs to be more specific in its proposal ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, the team really should work to make its product and offering more clear in concept and vision ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, it really needs to be more clear with the problem that is going to tackle ,0
www.ampleforth.org,this project needs more of real world identity since the team is not verified ,0
www.ampleforth.org, the concept is not explained anywhere in detail ,0
www.ampleforth.org, i will rate this as lowest considering authenticity of the project ,0
www.spindle.zone,this project needs more blockchain advisors to help with the ico success ,0
www.profyt.pro,this project need to be updated i will be happy to do another review once all informations requiered to understand the ico will be here ,0
www.profyt.pro, mvp a project like this seems dead feel free to contact me once updated ,0
onlinegamecoin.com,this project makes no sense to methere it totally no need for this kind of concepts and value ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, making strategies in the cryptospace its no good! this will be a really bad investment ,0
bitcache.com,this project looks very suspicious to me as currently the project's domain is for sale ,0
bitcache.com, also no kyc completed by the team members ,0
bitcache.com, benchy rates it less than one ,0
quant.network,this project looks very promising i like the multichain its will be very useful quant is a nice project to invest ,0
www.icebreakerar.com,this project looks very interesting and the website is very cool! congratulations!,1
platform.datachoice.io,this project looks very interesting,1
blockfreelancer.com,this project looks quite inresting,1
nomad.space,this project looks promising ,1
nomad.space, professional website and good to see that the development team is active and reliable in paying out bounties ,1
token.abacasexchange.com,this project looks promising ,1
token.abacasexchange.com, good luck!,1
patron-ico.io,this project looks promising and weird and that's good probably ,1
patron-ico.io, what did i mean with saying that: 0 atsushi hisatsumi is a well known personality he can deliver and i know that from his track record that gives all it takes to invest in this ico if you are into atsushi hisatsumi and/or business on social media influencers and it is expected to be weird to do business with a personality like atsushi hisatsumi ,1
patron-ico.io, that was one of the worst white papers i've seen for a long time ,0
patron-ico.io, it is ugly inconsistent unreadable and poorly translated ,0
patron-ico.io, it looks like a student's odd job ,0
patron-ico.io, probably a bit high student many times i was forced to guess what the author was trying o say e g wtf does that mean or even purchasing influencer for a year as an advertising tower by closing contract through web ? i guess that's google translate from japanese and you wanted to say something like a billboard but it is still a painful reading ,0
patron-ico.io, and do not get me wrong: that's ok to not be a master of foreign language as a person but it is not ok to show it in your official publications and offerings to investors while talking about million of usd hire a translator and a proofreader that's just a couple hundreds and i as investor won't be turned down by your presentation right away ,0
patron-ico.io, next the numbers: there are a lot of numbers in that wp but most of them either makes no sense or coming out of nowhere and leaving in the unknown direction ,0
patron-ico.io, what i mean is that gross profit transition chart literally has a lot of numbers with no ground under them and it's hard not to question it and i can go on forever with that wp it is just a limitless source of flaws and errors ,0
patron-ico.io, but i assume it was it's point: to prevent any professional investor from engaging so his curiosity and reasonable attitude won't be a problem to deal with later ,0
patron-ico.io, they want this to be crazy so come on board if you up to it without me this time although i will grab a popcorn and watch patron do great or burn great ,0
pindex.uci.global,this project looks promising!,1
bx.bet,this project looks promising indeed ,1
bx.bet, strong team behind it and a good business model ,1
bx.bet, this project reminds me of augur which was a huge success ,1
bx.bet, let user how this will go,1
grabameal.world,this project looks more promising with enhanced team ,1
pbet.io,this project looks like it could make very god use of blockchain technology in the ever expanding world of online gaming ,1
pbet.io, the team is talented and experienced the vision they have laid out is solid and the mvp looks good ,1
bitcache.com,this project looks like a scam to me as currently the project's domain is for sale ,0
bitcache.com, also no kyc completed by the team members ,0
bitcache.com, leave kyc they don't even have any picture or social media links attached to them ,0
cherr.io,this project looks interesting ,1
cherr.io, i hope it succeeds!,1
tradershub.io,this project looks interesting ,1
tradershub.io, as a former employee of a copy trading on blockchain i find some similarities with that project as well ,1
tradershub.io, here is what i think team several team members are missing linkedin including one of the co founders this is a concern when the co founder doesn't have linkedin ,0
tradershub.io, several other key players are also lacking linkedin ,0
tradershub.io, whether they simply don't have time or interest to link their profiles or there are other mysteries i am not sure ,0
tradershub.io, however this is a big red flag ,0
tradershub.io, i also didn't notice anyone from legal or marketing section in the team this is a trader+tech heavy team this team surely needs more diversity ,0
tradershub.io, 3/5 vision this is not first time someone is trying to build an improved all inclusive trading platform on blockchain ,1
tradershub.io, there has been multiple copy trading and social trading platforms with some failing and some are yet to deliver ,0
tradershub.io, however this project brings forward some very interesting ideas which if they can deliver will be simply awesome ,1
tradershub.io, i am particularly eager to try out mobile trading smart routing process advanced orders and live practice sessions with these features this platform can become the real one stop shop for new crypto traders ,1
tradershub.io, 4/5 product not sure how to rate on this in fact i feel icobench should change this section as many icos start without a product i don't know how to assuming they deliver even a conservative 50% of what they promise i would love to use it however this is unfair to assume they wont deliver ,1
tradershub.io, similarly not sure what the progress is at this stage staying positive ,1
tradershub.io, 4/5 good luck boys!,1
lapo.io,this project looks great ,1
lapo.io, ill wait your whitepaper for more details of this ,0
lapo.io, good luck dev!,1
www.ylifetoken.com,this project looks great ,1
aliveplaycasino.com,this project looks great because any person that want lending investing and mining can be achieved from this coin ,1
aliveplaycasino.com, i also want you to design and develop the roadmap as it is easier to understand with it ,1
gigzi.com,this project looks awesome ,1
gigzi.com, having biometric security is the future of blockchain,1
origintrail.io,this project look very promised,1
ndexnetwork.com,this project look good and i see team behind this project very experienced i hope this project can be success ,1
www.swapzilla.co,this project just finished their pre ico and is heading towards ico and they already have a working product ,1
www.swapzilla.co, i have made an account on their mvp and it looks promising ,1
www.swapzilla.co, their team has managed to put together a working demo product and for me this is a proof of their commitment towards this project and a really good sign that they are legit ,1
www.swapzilla.co, their vision is rather original as this infrastructure that they are building will help other crypto traders and eventually help the industry especially because trading and trading volume is what ultimately defines the price of coins and altcoins ,1
rateonium.com,this project is very unique that their rating platform has trading and investing functions as well as rating ,1
rateonium.com, currency rating system is too simple and there are many problems that anyone can rate product even by scammers the project solve this problem and make the rating system very efficient ,1
nodepower.io,this project is very promising ,1
nodepower.io, good luck guys!,1
povcoin.io,this project is very promising success,1
inbet.io,this project is very promising and i hope it will be useful for many people in the near future ,1
inbet.io, i wish you best on ico ,1
inbet.io, there are only few ico still base on neo and i think asura coin is most unique idea and definitely worth to invest and this is great chance to invest ,1
codeoftalent.io,this project is very potential for success,1
ito.cryptobuyer.io,this project is very interesting in terms of business functionality ,1
ito.cryptobuyer.io, team is impressive and they already have a working product good luck in developing the next stage of the business ,1
nursetoken.io,this project is very interesting and can be successful the number of coin supply is only million? sure will be successful,1
ndexnetwork.com,this project is very good nice work,1
tuurnt.io,this project is very good i think blockchain will benefit tuurnt ,1
tuurnt.io, its a good idea ,1
tuurnt.io, tuurnt has a great business model and team is very competitive and qualified ,1
tuurnt.io, the product is well structured ,1
tuurnt.io, this project is different for all others so i want give 5 stars ,1
tuurnt.io, i wouldn't usually give 5 stars all round i want to see all the project in action!,1
ellcrys.org,this project is underrated may be because of the team’s experience ,1
ellcrys.org, i will have to update ratings because they aren’t responsive on the project and investors from my consideration being a technology bind doesn’t need to prove experienced but they need to take responsibilities of delievering the prototype and project which i think won’t be fulfilled ,0
ellcrys.org, they have initiated a developer friendly environment which will make project management simpler ,1
ellcrys.org, this concept is very good however considering their team and the market studies i won’t recommend on either investment or any kind of trust for this project ,0
ellcrys.org, the mvp is in progress but since long there isn’t any update ,0
ellcrys.org, fyi i like your video a lot ,1
hnb.eco,this project is trying to challenge a fierce market instead of keeping the same pie it is important to see how to find a new pie but from the summary i could not find it ,0
hnb.eco, partner companies are rich and can be expected but can not access the white paper ,0
hnb.eco, it may be that there is a problem ,0
hnb.eco, i will wait for improvement ,1
ndexnetwork.com,this project is truly awesome and im sure it will be very successful,1
sarf.io,this project is the repetition of a lot of other projects i have seen in the cryptospace yet another exchange with an utility token + credit card their website is down and the account seem suspended not a good sign ,0
sarf.io, the mvp link is fake as it's an etherscan link to the erc20 deployed smart contract so i assume there is no mvp for real,0
sarf.io, i will come back and edit my review as these problems will be solved,1
cindx.io,this project is the one to make the crypto market take a massive step forward ,1

quant.network, but to me the problem they trying to solve and the way they want to achieve it makes quant possible next big thing !,1
snapparazzi.io,this project is refreshingly commercial and actually rather exciting ,1
snapparazzi.io, will boil down to execution to bring out success ,1

tokensale.shping.com,this project is really great ,1
tokensale.shping.com, very strong team with huge experience and already working product ,1

kikicoin.pw,this project is really ambitious and the team is small and without any solid experience ,0
kikicoin.pw, they advisors are a handful of companies that nobody knows off ,0
kikicoin.pw, their vision for this project incorporates a range of services but i really don't see how they will achieve this with the current team ,0
www7.universa.io,this project is real disaster ,0
www7.universa.io, not working product ,0
www7.universa.io, they missed all promised dates on availability of tokens after they launched a mainnet ,0
www7.universa.io, terrible telegram admins and community ,0
www7.universa.io, dead volume on exchanges ,0

bitrewards.network, i hope you have success with it good luck!,1
www.menapay.io,this project is pretty interesting ,1
www.menapay.io, the team is really big which is a really good sign ,1
www.menapay.io, the idea is decent but it'll be very tough to achieve adoption ,0
www.menapay.io, also there is no product to look at the moment so i'll update the rating when the app is made ,0
www.yinc.com,this project is one of the most interesting ones as far as i know with a great future ahead i wish you grand success,1
www.bidooh.io,this project is one of the more interesting and eye catching projects out there ,1
www.bidooh.io, this is something that's more than needed and bidooh is in the best position to revolutionize the digital billboard advertising space ,1
www.bidooh.io, this is definitely that i'm looking forward to watching ,1
www.bidooh.io, strong team ready to deliver ,1
covalentcoin.io,this project is on ico bench for quite a while and yet they have no team or details ,0
covalentcoin.io, i can't rate it without any details ,0
covalentcoin.io, they also have no product details as well ,0
venusenergy.io,this project is obviously trying to make a difference in an area that needs it renewable energy ,1
venusenergy.io, the team looks ok but a bit on the small side ,0
venusenergy.io, a solid vision and i look forward to seeing the mvp in the future,1
www.payeercoin.com,this project is not well differentiated from other companies we should create more specific points of differentiation ,0
www.payeercoin.com, i am also concerned that some of the team members have a bad reputation ,0
dataeum.com,this project is not unique to the blockchain and people have attempted similar projects before hand in order to succeed they would require a large number of participants in their crowd sourcing efforts ,0
dataeum.com, the team is good and is backed by a good set of advisors ,1
deepcloudai.com,this project is not an easy ico project ,0
deepcloudai.com, it does not select erc 20 in thinking stop state as many projects do ,0
deepcloudai.com, they create the optimal platform for their solution excellent solution including ai · transfer and furthermore we will develop our own block chain ,1
deepcloudai.com, the token balance and financial plan are pure ,1
deepcloudai.com, i have the power to choose the best method after doing solid analysis ,1
deepcloudai.com, team members are experienced and powerful ,1
deepcloudai.com, i keep on watching this project eyes and watch over it ,1
socialmedia.market,this project is neither bad nor good in my opinion i should say there was a bit fomo but it still deserves a good comment ,1
socialmedia.market, so i believe my points would be: team: 3 vision: 4 product: 4,1
singaporedcoin.com,this project is misleading as it is attempting to use the singapore brand name by spelling it with a missing e ,0
singaporedcoin.com, there is no detail of its execution and possibly the project is non existent ,0
www.kabntoken.com,this project is looking really good to me ,1
www.kabntoken.com, it's a very promising financial service platform which is gdpr compliant and it has blockchain and biometrically based identity verification ,1
www.kabntoken.com, there si constantly increasing need to convert digital currencies back to traditional currencies so i see a high demand for this type of services in the future ,1
www.kabntoken.com, they are launching digital currency card that is approved by visa ,1
www.kabntoken.com, team is looking very professional and experienced ,1
www.kabntoken.com, engineers with lots of experience ,1
www.kabntoken.com, their ceo has over 20 years of account management business development marketing and partnership experience ,1
www.kabntoken.com, looking forward to see how this project evolves ,1
eiracube.io,this project is led by an aggressive person named kosta that insulted me even though i had invested in the project ,0
eiracube.io, it made me lose hope about the leadership ,0
eiracube.io, regarding the vision and product i believe there is a lot fomo going on here i know it is nice to have robots serve you but i expect a global financial crisis and i think a lot of stores at the shopping malls will go bankrupt it might even make some malls to go bankrupt as well ,0
eiracube.io, in this context i highly doubt the success of this project regardless of kosta's rudeness ,0
gabrotech.io,this project is indeed a good use case but it is an ambitious one too ,1
gabrotech.io, i have no further comments on other aspects just one point is its softcap without a softcap what will happen if a hardcap is not reached? will the tokensale last forever? this is a big concern for investors that the team must address ,0
gabrotech.io, good luck,1
snbtoken.io,this project is hot!! i like that synchrobit coverts many aspects of commodities such as precious metals ,1
snbtoken.io, snb token covered in forbes and yahoo finance shows me that the team is both professional and serious and that gives investors something to be confident about! congratulations guys!! well done!!,1
quant.network,this project is going to bridge all erc20 tokens together ,1
quant.network, this is going to blow up boys! and they are airdropping on bounty0x so get in while its hot ,1
cryptosoul.io,this project is going to be fun ,1
cryptosoul.io, it is well thought out for the market because they have plans of burn and lockup i hope that it will not become a reality money power = game power ,1
ausdigitaldollar.online,this project is going to be a huge success,1
wpay.sg,this project is flying in under the radar but has all the elements to be highly successful ,1
wpay.sg, this is a long term tracking project ,1
wpay.sg, if i were taking on any new projects to be an advisor i’d jump all over this one ,1
wpay.sg, i like how they structured their teams ,1
wpay.sg, smart people here ,1
www.bitacium.io,this project is difficult to rate as there is no leadership appointed for the role of ceo ,0
www.bitacium.io, all the best!,1
www.bitacium.io, richard usman ico team member replied on 4 feb 2019 hello clemen the founder and ceo of bitacium llc is richard usman the website was updated dear richard thank you for responding ,1
www.bitacium.io, i've visited your linkedin page at however you did not list down your previous employment and past experiences ,0
www.bitacium.io, it is difficult to assess your credentials for this project ,0
jointedu.io,this project is definately going to be a winner ,1
www.dochain.org,this project is clearly missing a lot of information like the member's social network which is very very important to get credibility from investors ,0
www.dochain.org, first of all i can't see any links to their website and wp,0
www.hashcard.io,this project is being accused of being a scam ,0
www.skyfchain.io,this project is awesome which bring blockchain + drone technology to a new level ,1
www.skyfchain.io, the team looks strong the value proposition and introduction is clear the token economy model is ok ,1
www.skyfchain.io, which make this project is reliable and worth to take a deep review ,1
ico.htfx.online,this project is an ico that is labeled suspicious ico ,0
ico.htfx.online, member's kyc also seems to have been left unsuccessful ,0
ico.htfx.online, first of all they should enrich their information within this site ,0
ico.ezpos.io,this project is an amalgam of marketing and customer loyalty management services ,1
ico.ezpos.io, really a wise implementation of blockchain technology ,1
ico.ezpos.io, eztoken has a clear economy and its use in the project’s eco ,1
ico.ezpos.io, system is justified ,1
ico.ezpos.io, there is a clearly defined and understood business model ,1
ico.ezpos.io, the nature and scope of the fundamental problems and salvations as well as the big idea are clearly identified ,1

kinesis.money, outstanding team assembled ,1
kinesis.money, all the best!,1
kaasy.ai,this project is amazing and the team,1
littlephil.org,this project is actually huge and i hope it stays under the radar ,1
www.humancoin.net,this project is a very interesting and useful ,1
www.humancoin.net, charity is always associated with scams and through human coin this notion can be changed and more money can be channeled into charity correctly ,1
pbet.io,this project is a unique innovation that addresses the convergence between physical and online gaming through a unified gaming platform ,1
pbet.io, it integrates crypto currencies instant payments and combining partners in a unique token based reward club overall a great platform,1
www.ultrix.co,this project is a scam ,0
www.ultrix.co, they are using the names and faces of another team ,0
steincoin.org,this project is a scam ,0
steincoin.org, proof: this project is a scam ,0
www.ylifetoken.com,this project is a nice concept ,1
www.ylifetoken.com, it has the potentials to elevate the livelihood of mankind through its token ,1
www.ylifetoken.com, the team and management are really doing a great job!!!!,1
onlinegamecoin.com,this project is a joke and a clear example of how desperate they are to do an ico when they dont even know the basic parameters to do a successful ico ,0
quant.network,this project is a hidden gem ,1
quant.network, the concept is interesting ,1
keplertek.io,this project is a big yet ambitious one ,1
keplertek.io, however the concept is interesting with a solid and diversified team ,1
keplertek.io, mvp is great too ,1
keplertek.io, i think this is a good ico and it will be a great success if it is implemented properly with set goals and strategies ,1
crypt-on.io,this project if and when developed and implemented accurately will be very convenient to all its users ,1
crypt-on.io, by putting to good use the four services this is offering we will see how very useful this entire project will be ,1
crypt-on.io, i’ve noticed also that it has already created some ripples in the cryptoworld and it has gained a good following on social media channels too ,1
crypt-on.io, an mvp is available and also a good team that has good knowledge in their fields and i believe they can accomplish their roadmap ,1
honeypod.org,this project idea has immense potential to reduce online crime if it manages to succeed ,1
honeypod.org, however like many have mentioned a breakdown of the financials would help clear a lot of misunderstandings ,1
www.howdoo.io,this project have a promising idea ,1
www.howdoo.io, howdoo will introduce a cryptographic token called µdoo as the vehicle for transferring value between users advertisers and operators of the howdoo network ,1
www.vite.org,this project have a good idea!! team is very strong and smooth! ,1
www.vite.org,but connecty will compete a lots project like this! so i think this project need more something different than another project!,0
www.vite.org,but i think connecty is insteresting project and i will follow it!! thanks and good luck team,1
www.deepaero.com,this project has very strong tech expert advisors ,1
www.deepaero.com, dr garamalvi and his peers are top in the world ,1
www.deepaero.com, this project has the strongest players in the field with excellent vision ,1
yudi.io,this project has raised several red flags ,0
yudi.io, i contacted every listed advisor so far two have responded to let me know that they were not advisors to this project ,0
yudi.io, the team members have not responded to me and every single one of them had a brand new linkedin account ,0
yudi.io, of course linkedin isn't the reason for my ratings here but it is definitely an eyebrow raiser ,0
yudi.io, i look forward to hearing an explanation from this team ,0
yudi.io, i don't think anything will excuse the use of advisors profiles without permission ,0
yudi.io, nothing short of a bug in icobench's code that accidentally placed the wrong info on this page will suffice ,0
yudi.io, beware of this project ,0
yudi.io,this project has raised several red flags for me and seems like i am not the one other experts have felt the same way ,0
yudi.io, i would highly avoid it ,0
yudi.io, also seems like the entire team failed kyc which is a red sign for me ,0
ico.kuende.com,this project has potential ,1
ico.kuende.com, it will be challenging because of the social space is crowded ,0
ico.kuende.com, the team is strong and i love the vision of eliminating the dark side of social media which is social isolation ,1
ico.kuende.com, the gamfication aspect of doing that along with taking queues from competitors like meetup and improving on them the fact that they have received 2.6 million in funding is a positive sign as well ,1
ico.kuende.com, its going to be challenging but i hope they can pull it off ,1
ico.kuende.com, in general in this market all icos are very risky at this point and if you invest there is a good chance that your investment will fall once the token begins trading ,0
volentix.io,this project has potential to make things easier in the blockchain ecosystem ,1
volentix.io, i was watching closely and monitoring the project ,1
volentix.io, hopefully we will get to see more projects like this one,1 
ico.triip.me,this project has me excited,1
keenplatform.com,this project has great potential ,1
keenplatform.com, good luck to the team ,1
cotrader.com,this project has great opportunities to take the lead ,1
cotrader.com, they created a more convenient technology for ico projects and everything is done to ensure that the projects at the ico stage attracted great interest in themselves thanks to their reliability ,1
cotrader.com, all information on the links,1
cotrader.com,this project has got a lot of attentions as its twitter followers have more than 30k ,1
cotrader.com, the price of token won't go up in the future because the number of tokens are relatively high ,0
cotrader.com, the team members look great and i'm looking forward to it succeed ,1
www.oppopenwifi.com,this project has everything one should look for in an ico ,1
www.oppopenwifi.com, close team that has work history a much needed product a github full of life an active community great leadership that actually understands the tech and competition in and out of the crypto space ,1
www.oppopenwifi.com, i have my eyes on this project and so far i have not seen any red flags ,1
www.oppopenwifi.com, great job guys ,1
www.blockcollider.org,this project has been essentially off the 'mainstream rating radar' however mark my words this is going to be a very strong project ,1
keplertek.io,this project has all the right buzzwords: robotics ai and blockchain ,1
keplertek.io, but all it really proposes is a marketplace platform for investing in robotics and high tech ,0
keplertek.io, why create an investment marketplace limited to those technologies? and why use blockchain? the answer isn't clear at all ,0
keplertek.io, if the team had members with a background in either robotics or ai and could justify why you need a specialized marketplace built on the blockchain just for that purpose it might be more compelling ,0
keplertek.io, i suggest they build up their team in that regard ,0
keplertek.io, i also don't understand why they are building on ethereum ,0
keplertek.io, most serious projects are now opting for alternative blockchain networks that can scale ,0
keplertek.io, ethereum will likely get there in the future but it is not there now ,0
keplertek.io, finally according to the whitepaper kepler will enable its token holders to own electronic shares of the company and be entitled to dividends ,1
keplertek.io, if that's not a security token then i don't know what is ,0
keplertek.io, as a result they are going to have a very hard time getting their token listed on any major exchanges ,0
keplertek.io, i think this project has potential,1
keplertek.io, but the founders need to address some of the serious issues before ,0
keplertek.io,it deserves a second look ,1
ito.cryptobuyer.io,this project has a working mvp ,1
ito.cryptobuyer.io, their team is well balanced but has only 9 members and 8 advisors ,0
ito.cryptobuyer.io, they seem truly excited and dedicated though ,1
ito.cryptobuyer.io, i highly recommend you to enhance your team for the success of the ico ,0
ito.cryptobuyer.io, aside from this their vision and product are not unique or original ,0
ito.cryptobuyer.io,but in the end what will make the difference will be their mindset and how will they implement it on the market and of course their networking ,1
ito.cryptobuyer.io, good luck!,1
stacktical.com,this project has a very great idea in this fast growing space ,1
stacktical.com, the team is small ,0
stacktical.com,but i’d assume that’ll be adding more in the near future ,1
stacktical.com, by targeting service providers like exchanges and tech companies it may be harder for them to create that buzz like other projects on the block ,0
stacktical.com, i’ve had the opportunity to ask questions directly to the project which i received back in a very reasonable time ,1
stacktical.com, personally i’ve run into issues they’re looking to solve remember binance when trx mooned? this project will help the crypto world take the next step towards mass adoption by assuring systems stay working especially during big news movements ,1
stacktical.com, i see that some exchanges have deposit/withdraw and trading issues like hitbtc with some nep5 tokens right now ,0
stacktical.com, again the space is moving at such a fast pace that support like projects to help providers is definitely needed ,1
stacktical.com, a lot of projects are doing the same thing creating high competition exchanges platforms supply chain we’ve seen it already ,0
stacktical.com, it’s nice to see something different for once ,1
stacktical.com, good luck guys! excited to see who you partner with ,1
www.cowrium.net,this project has a very active telegram community ,1
www.cowrium.net, i am curious to see how this nigerian exchange will take form in the future ,1
www.cowrium.net, from what i've seen on their website socials and whitepaper it looks good on all aspects and it has potential,1 
www.cowrium.net, will follow its evolution into the future ,1
www.iagon.com,this project has a strong team with great diversification of expertise and experiences,1 
www.iagon.com, vision is not new to me ,0
www.iagon.com,but if it is done right on the blockchain technology it can be a great project ,1
www.iagon.com, still eager to see at least its demo or mvp to have more detailed review ,1
www.bridgecoin.io,this project has a lot of potential ,1
www.bridgecoin.io, the team seems to be well verse in the forex space and this will no doubt help them get traction in whats is certainly going to be a challenging project ,1
www.bridgecoin.io, bridging the divide between crypto and forex is a concept that could really capture a fairly large market/audience ,1
www.bridgecoin.io, i am rating this project with the assumption that they will complete their kyc should they fail then i will have to re evaluate my score,0 
www.yinc.com,this project has a lot of potential to be successful however they must continue working on it and not let it die ,1
www.distichain.com,this project has a lot of potential as they are disrupting a multi billion dollar supply chain industry ,1
www.distichain.com, the partners in leading distributors gives distichain an edge over many other pre revenue projects ,1
www.distichain.com, the use of blockchain is also novel and has good tokenomics deployed ,1
migranet.io,this project has a great vision ,1
migranet.io, i had the possibility to chat with the founder fully available to give me more information on migranet i think migranet has substance and hope the best results for the team ,1
migranet.io, in my opinion they could have some problem with data protection once the project will be implemented in the european area due to gdpr ,0
migranet.io, blockchain could help solve the problem ,1
migranet.io, let's see what the solution will be!,1
keplertek.io,this project has a great team in place ,1
keplertek.io, i like where this project can go with the ai ,1
keplertek.io, mvp is in place ,1
keplertek.io, it will be interesting to see the full development of this project ,1
safehaven.io,this project has a definite use case for the real world and the crypto space ,1
safehaven.io, team is decent ,1
safehaven.io, however it will be difficult to get mainstream adoption because most people will not trust an unknown platform ,0
suchapp.io,this project has a bright future!,1
tecracoin.io,this project has a balanced team in numbers and skills ,1
tecracoin.io, their requested team members passed the kyc ,1
tecracoin.io, it has a working mvp ,1
tecracoin.io, they only distribute 10% during ico ,1
tecracoin.io, their vision is rather interesting i am looking forward to seeing how they will implement it on the market good luck!,1
livenpay.io,this project doing a good job on a lot of things ,1
livenpay.io, by the way i wonder if this project will be of interest to investors even after ico i think more differentiated strategies are important because there are so many similar projects it will have to be done continuously,0
www.playgame.com,this project designed for many people involved in games as well as users of games is highly demanded ,1
www.playgame.com, it is ideal that anyone can freely design and play html5 games ,1
www.playgame.com, the team seems to be experienced and necessary and sufficient ,1
www.playgame.com, the token balance is also well designed ,1
www.playgame.com, i could not find the mvp ,0
www.playgame.com, but their achievement is high if i look at the results i will wait for mvp ,1
xaya.io,this project could have an really bright future ,1
xaya.io,but i'm not sure if its not a little bit ahead of his time cheesy hopefully it gets adopted since that is all that matters on gaming platforms !,1
xaya.io,you have a really nice looking wallet btw,1
www.emjac.io,this project comes from a very good idea ,1
www.emjac.io, it is an excellent platform for both business and ecology ,1
www.emjac.io, it is often said that businesses that are born from ideas that are unthinkable to selfish people are successful especially in these days when crypto fraud cases are increasing projects like them will be very useful ,1
ico.kuende.com,this project challenges the industry that has already saturated better teams and better innovative ideas are required ,0
ico.kuende.com, the team seems to be better ,1
ico.kuende.com,but the idea is not innovative ,0
ico.kuende.com, despite the presence of mvp the price difference between softcap and hardcap is large but it seems there is no rational explanation ,0
www.cryptomarketads.com,this project can be a gamechanger if all implementations are ready ,1
www.cryptomarketads.com, i like the vision ,1
www.cryptomarketads.com,but there are many other projects and competitors time will show ,1
www.cryptomarketads.com, all in all it is a good project with good team and whitepaper ,1
www.cryptomarketads.com, all the best for you! this review is my personal sight and the team can contact me anytime to discuss my review ,1
www.inzura.world,this product is very important for building an increase in trust in the crypto world ,1
www.inzura.world, the current insurance market for crypto is small and largely only available to big consumers and enterprises ,0
www.inzura.world, the product doesn't clarify well enough how it will be able to detect scammers which could put the entire insurance organization at risk,0
www.cryptassist.io,this product is looking cool and awesome ,1
www.cryptassist.io, their team seems to be hard working ,1
www.cryptassist.io, i read a little bit about their project and it seems to be a genuine one ,1
www.cryptassist.io, let's see what will be the future ,1
medicalchain.com,this product is definitely needed ,1
medicalchain.com, there are many competitors ,0
medicalchain.com, medibloc seems to be a bit further ahead as far a current development ,1
medicalchain.com, but both are still very early in the process ,0
orisspace.io,this process is described in the whute pepper,1
cedex.com, i like the concept but not directly clear to me how it will be executed ,0
beatlecoin.com,this one looks bad ,0
beatlecoin.com, no team links website or social ,0
beatlecoin.com, be careful with this one ratings are that of opinion and not to be financial advice of any kind and in no way should be considered endorsement of any project ,0
beatlecoin.com, please do your own due diligence on anything you invest in!,1
aco.ai,this one just did not do the appropriate research prior to the ico ,0
aco.ai, no chance of success in my opinion ,0
aco.ai, of late they have caused many investors to back off ,0
bloom.co,this numbers are out of space i wish thought here is coinmarkecap : $1.3,1
verasity.io,this new project for me i never look previously maybe because i less read in announcement when i look and read the content i am very interested to join this project and became the participant,1
casperproject.io,this new ico sounds really interesting!,1
airbloc.org,this needs to stop ,0
airbloc.org, they are 10000 of decentralized personal data protocol i mean a lot of tokens in order to secure your personal data cookies and selling tokenize such products has no economical value whatsoever ,0
iconiqlab.com,this might help the mainstream market break into blockchain ,1
iconiqlab.com, i wish the best for you guys!,1
www.mbccoin.co,this may be a scam ,0
www.mbccoin.co, support is non existent ,0
www.mbccoin.co, will not respond to any email request ,0
www.mbccoin.co, it's like they've taken the money and ran ,0
tokensale.menubuzz.com,this make no sense whatsover ,0
tokensale.menubuzz.com, there are too many products out or coming out in this crowded space that translate cryto to fiat on a pos system or chip and pin ,0
tokensale.menubuzz.com, nothin special here ,0
tokensale.menubuzz.com, also there has been little or no effort in engaging the community ,0
tokensale.menubuzz.com, no kyc conducted ,0
rloop.org,this looks very worth watching ,1
ethorse.com,this looks like it could be a sleeper ico ,0
ethorse.com, between the whitepaper faq and telegram the team has offered as much information as possible as you can as an anonymous team while i was hesitant of the anonymity at first the reasons they've given in their transparency disclosure are valid and the ropsten dapp and github activity speak for themselves ,1
ethorse.com, most importantly it's an ico where blockchain actually serves a purpose ,1
ethorse.com, between the trustless smart contracts and operation within an over ,1
ethorse.com, regulated industry ethorse has a place in the blockchain and cryptography realm ,1
ethorse.com, i think some minor ux enhancements will go a long way for users ,0
ethorse.com, for investors if the team meets expectations owning horse will be an extremely fruitful endeavor ,1
www.xcoynz.com,this looks like an interesting project ,1
www.xcoynz.com, has a good team and the whitepaper is well drafted ,1
www.xcoynz.com, they have a poc and kyc has been completed ,1
www.xcoynz.com, these are the kind of projects that will help create mass adoption of cryptocurrency ,1
www.xcoynz.com, good luck would like to see this project take shape ,1
arciris.info,this looks like an interesting project with lots of potential ,1
arciris.info, strong experienced team with a good vision ,1
arciris.info, the whitepaper is detailed and covers all the relevant information ,1
arciris.info, will update team score to 5 once kyc is complete,1
tokensale.energypremier.com,this looks like an interesting project,1
tokensale.shping.com,this looks like a well thought out project ,1
tokensale.shping.com, the ball now falls in the hand of the team to make this project a huge success ,1
tokensale.shping.com, if they do things right this can get really big ,1
www.datablockchain.io,this looks like a solid project from what i can see ,1
www.datablockchain.io, they have numerous us patents including one us7136880b2 for methods for compiling business data ,1
www.datablockchain.io, a fairly experienced team and already developed mvp ,1
www.datablockchain.io, partnerships established ,1
www.datablockchain.io, will report back if any red flags come to my attention i've also started an icocheck github issue request feel free to contribute!,1
lamden.io,this looks like a solid project !! i love the concept this is exactly something that developing ico's and blockchain companies need as resource ,1
lamden.io, solid work guys i look forward to seeing more from lamden ,1
snbtoken.io,this looks like a really strong project in my opinion ,1
snbtoken.io, the team is highly experienced and so to is the advisory board ,1
snbtoken.io, i have personally worked with a few of the team members and advisors on other projects and i know them all to be stand up people ,1
snbtoken.io, the company vision is solid and even though there are a few competitors in this space i believe the market is big enough to accommodate multiple players ,1
irbis.network,this looks like a really promising project ,1
irbis.network, irbis network comes with a working mvp and is backed by a capable team of experts ,1
irbis.network, their representatives have already passed kyc which is another good sign ,1
irbis.network, during their ico they are distributing only 40% of their tokens and this is a clear sign of commitment from their side to the future evolution of this project ,1
irbis.network, i enjoyed reading their whitepaper as it is investor friendly and has all the details one needs to understand the full potential of this project ,1
cogmento.com,this looks like a really promising project with limitless potential ,1
cogmento.com, when i used to work in the corporate sector i know how important and valuable a good crm package was to increase sales ,1
cogmento.com, i also know how insanely expensive and cumbersome the traditional crm packages are ,1
cogmento.com, the whitepaper is detailed whilst being concise at the same time no fluff content to try make the document bigger like what so other many ico's do ,1
cogmento.com, the team is small but they are highly experienced in their respective fields ,1
cogmento.com, all in all this project certainly looks like one to keep a close eye on ,1
www.ahrvo.io,this looks like a really awesome project ,1
www.ahrvo.io, strong team with an excellent concept ,1
www.ahrvo.io, they already have a working product so that's even better ,1
www.ahrvo.io, the whitepaper and website is well written provides all the relevant information ,1
www.ahrvo.io, this is certainly one to keep a close eye on ,1
geco.one,this looks like a rather interesting project ,1
geco.one,whilst i do agree my fellow bench expert igor that the mvp doesn't really offer much functionality ,0
geco.one, after having a good look at the team's impressive experience i'm going to go out on a limb and say that i think they could actually pull this off ,1
geco.one, there are other pamm trading platforms catering for the crypto market but i believe the market is big enough to accommodate multiple platforms in this space more so because the market size is continuously growing ,1
www.quasa.io,this looks like a promising project ,1
www.quasa.io, i like the idea and as many of us already know the potential for blockchain use cases in the logistics and supply chain sector is huge ,1
www.quasa.io, the whitepaper is well written and they have a strong team with a solid advisory board ,1
www.quasa.io, whats also good to see is that have a decent sized technical/development team ,1
www.quasa.io, this is normally something see far too many ico's ignoring good to see that they are not top heavy with too many unnecessary senior management roles ,1
www.uhive.com,this looks like a promising project and it is led by a team who seemingly have the knowledgeand experience to implement it correctly ,1
www.uhive.com, keep up the good work,1
token.solidified.io,this looks like a promising project a very solid team mind the pun with a plenty of experience ,1
token.solidified.io, the concept is great and i believe they have the skills set to pull this off ,1
token.solidified.io, the are playing in a very niche market and have a lot to bring to the table ,1
investx.io,this looks like a private stock exchange which requires regulatory approval from the domicile country ,0
investx.io, which country will be business be based in? thanks clemen we're in the uk and will be regulated in the uk by the fca ,1
investx.io, do you know when your project will receive the regulatory approval from the fca? peter edgar ico team member replied on 2 oct 2018 for alpha platform go live jun19 we will be operating under a partner company's existing fca approval as an fca authorised person and this is a common structure in the uk we aim to have our own approval by october 2019 ,1
investx.io, our solicitors in the uk are cms law who have worked with us to ensure the platform delivery works with our regulatory approval roadmap approval will be around october 2019 ,1
investx.io, all the best!,1
licerio.org,this looks like a great project ,1
www.marginless.io,this looks like a good team who have knowledge in the industry the blockchain skills can be bought in knowing the industry and having a product before is way more important and i think they have that ,1
www.marginless.io, its competitive with companies like luckbox who also have strong teams and are going after esports ,1
www.marginless.io, this will be competitive but i think a large market and they may have a niche in the region where they have been operating before,1
beat.org,this looks like a good idea without a unique story to tell the marketplace,1 
beat.org, yes we need blockchain in sport ,1
beat.org, safety is important and there is so much we can get from the data ,1
pacmancoin.com,this looks like a complete scam ,0
pacmancoin.com, there is no kyc no social channel links no prototype token metrics are really bad one of the worst whitepapers i've ever read,0
www.skaratoken.com,this looking like a promising project,1
ico.coinnup.com,this look great ,1
ico.coinnup.com, good job ,1
ico.coinnup.com, will be following this,1
onlinegamecoin.com,this just doesn't look like a professional offering ,1
onlinegamecoin.com, i'm very cautious to give bad ratings on ico bench but this one i had to the vision the team the grammar etc this needs some brand work and also at the moment just looks a little sketchy to me ,0
onlinegamecoin.com, hope to be proven wrong,1
arciris.info,this issue has been discussed in crypto space and out there a lot but actually issue isn’t gone mining spent vast amount of electricity around the globe for sure it has to be green and not environment disruptive ,1
arciris.info, that’s why this team here proud of them and wish the best luck of their great job!,1
grondigital.com,this isn't certainly a project that would make the world a better place but they have a solid business idea and experienced team to build their product good luck!,1
imigize.io,this isn't at all a bad project as the commercial need and viability is strong ,1
imigize.io, the product is certainly need in the industry the only thing is making sure blockchain is definitely required here else its just a platform on blockchain project ,0
qlink.mobi,this isn't an erc20 token ,0
qlink.mobi, sort yourselves out ,0
qlink.mobi, amateur mistake ,0
vtuur.io,this isn't a few of the guys first foray into the vr space which is good to see ,1
vtuur.io, but the good kind of ends there ,0
vtuur.io, the idea doesn't really make sense for the need for crypto ,0
vtuur.io, i get that you're trying to make a platform for people to try and stream the world and fill it with digital advertisers to pay for it through the token but why do you really need the token for that? why can't they just pay you in fiat for ad space? likewise i can't rate the product high yet because you don't actually have anything for us to try out ,0
vtuur.io, anyone can create a video and make it look how you want it too ,0
view.ly,this isn't a big deal at all ,0
view.ly, seen this for many icos that end up doing well ,1
view.ly, guarantee this isn't pursued they don't have time to follow through on every little complaint from whiney people like you just because your eth was locked up a few months ,0
www.doctailor.com,this is very strange the website states doctailor is a trading company of zloadr limited registered in the uk company number 08941832 when you look at companie house for the uk company there is a notice to strike off within 2 months from 12 june 18 the director david williams was registed at companies house with dob july 79 when initially appointed a darren williams with same dob was also appointed so it woudl be good to get confirmation that there are twins or it is unusual ,0
www.doctailor.com, david williams was then terminated and reappointed later with a change in dob to dec 79 considering the above ack of clarity and possible striking off of the comapny and the poor quality of the white paper which gives no subsance in my view i dont see this as a positive project at all with several risks ,0
www.doctailor.com, if they dont sort the strike off out then any funds raised to that daye will go to uk crown knight capital the 'fund' that the founder states he has on linked in also just a uk shell comapny also due to be sruck off two months from 12th june and website empty ,0
verime.mobi,this is very potential project which is build to update blockchain service ,1
ndexnetwork.com,this is very amazing project and have a good team,1
www.aimedis.com,this is truly a great vision with implementation of ai and unique in offering videochat and communication in the platform where even different patients with the same illnesses can provide support and guidance to each other ,1
www.aimedis.com, there might be hitches but having such detailed planning by medical professionals could make this a great investment opportunity ,1
www.aimedis.com, the competitors do exist quite a lot of new icos in healthcare sphere ,0
Moveco.io,this is the wrong video i'm unsure where you got this from,0
lenuschain.io,this is the wearable health market the team looks capable ,1
lenuschain.io, the blockchain use case is not strong nor is the market awareness ,0
www.atronocom.io,this is the usual answere which i get when i protect my position and says a lot! i am not worry at all you due dilligence superstar!!! ,1
www.atronocom.io,i am just sick and tired of bad mood monkeys who try to destroy everything!,0
www.atronocom.io, have a great day ,1
socialgood-foundation.com,this is the type of project that makes me think my move back to asia is the right thing to do ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, i love it ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, the team have the experience and more important will have the network to drive this to traction and growth ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, its a large amount to raise of course but this an ambitious project and onboarding of partners and users is not cheap and its good to have powder in the tank to drive the growth and adoption ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, the growth of rewards as a customer loyalty system to drive reengagement is huge and i like the way this is structured ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, i also like the token price i am becoming more comfortable with a token having a relatively high unit cost as its gives perceived value to token and makes user want to hold and look after them ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, the model is smart ,1
socialgood-foundation.com, very much looking forward to seeing the progress here as this can be a big one and a large brand very quickly i hope it works for me when i get to hong kong in october,1
www.casperproject.io,this is the state every product should be in before attempting an ico ,1
www.casperproject.io, mvp done solid information in whitepaper team experienced and professional ,1
seal.network,this is the sort of idea for which blockchain was made ,1
seal.network, therefore this is a logical play ,1
seal.network, these guys are not the only people aiming to do so though,0 
seal.network, so a lot will depend on their execution and ability to differentiate from competitors ,0
vrt.world, no more comment i report this ico ,0
stellargoldcoin.com,this is the project but they are scammers ,0
stellargoldcoin.com, i do not know how there are comments supporting this project and the administrators are rude and mocking,0
decentraland.org, my review is not using any methodology to decide if the project is a scam or operates any other shady scheme ,1
decentraland.org, this is a project review pointing out mostly on incorporation of different technologies ,1
decentraland.org, i used published information on icobench and project links ,1
decentraland.org, i was not financially compensated in any way for posting this review ,1
decentraland.org, the opinions expressed are my own and are based on my observations while reading the white paper and published project’s information ,1
perlin.net,this is the one ,1
www.starkware.co,this is the one ,1
squeezer.io,this is the new level of blockchain development environment ,1
ausdigitaldollar.online,this is the most promising project,1
ggxproject.com,this is the most bloated and nonsensical project i've come across ,0
ggxproject.com,what they are raising works out to be approximately $30m usd and that's only 0.1% of their tokens they are essentially saying their 179 patents allow them to initially value their company at $30b they claim their patents will be worth $10s of billions with no studies to back that up ,0
ausdigitaldollar.online,this is the most awaited project in cryptoworld,1
medicohealth.io,this is the industry where i think blockchain can be useful and will provide some comprehensive results ,1
medicohealth.io, the team has done a great job on the website and whitepaper ,1
medicohealth.io, however i think the vision can limit to very specific region unless worked on so please be sure it reaches across the globe ,1
medicohealth.io, i wish this project to get success and it will get success as per current team’s efforts ,1
tradingene.io,this is the hottest ico i hope it worths with all the trouble,1
quant.network,this is the future we have been waiting for ,1
quant.network, this project has a huge potential! advance congratulations to the team!,1
www.yourdatasafe.io,this is the first ico i have invested in this year ,1
www.yourdatasafe.io, real world use great token metrics solid team and an unbelievable project with a very clear road map ,1
www.nagaico.com,this is the fintech startup that could and should disrupt the current obsolete banking services ,1
districts.io,this is the currency you will use in the future to solve real world problems ,1
proximax.io,this is the child project of nem lead by lon wong president of the nem foundation ,1
proximax.io, proximax is a new blockchain platform and supporting a utility token will help build next generation peer to peer dapp storage and media delivery based on nem’s blockchain protocol ,1
proximax.io, proximax will also use the entire power of catapult a recent engine of nem blockchain which allows to developers some functions impossible on other blockchains!,1
ndexnetwork.com,this is the best project and i like this coin,1
www.concertvr.io,this is something cool and could be a breakthrough in the music industry but the challenge is in the implementation ,1
www.concertvr.io, goodluck ,1
orisspace.io,this is something completely new among the banal! this is interesting ,1
orisspace.io,it is not clear and therefore attract again and again attention to himself ,0
orisspace.io, i want to comprehend this unknown keep up with the time to be in the trend! ,1
orisspace.io,good luck to the developers!,1
tradingene.io,this is some serious project u guys have here ,1
tradingene.io, to have a unique wallet is awesome good luckk,1
zamanat.net,this is some serious project u guys have here ,1
moneytoken.com,this is smart ,1
moneytoken.com, i like it ,1
moneytoken.com, the first interesting financial ico i have seen in some time ,1
moneytoken.com, great idea ,1
moneytoken.com, good team could be bigger though ,1
dizcovery.network,this is ringing all kinds of alarm bells ,1
dizcovery.network, no kyc ,0
dizcovery.network, small team without experience ,0
dizcovery.network, advertizing niche prone to scams ,0
dizcovery.network, sharing economy even more scammy ,0
dizcovery.network, whitepaper all fluff and no content ,0
dizcovery.network, no relevant crypto advisors,0
www.bitfinex.com,this is really strong exchange ,1
www.bitfinex.com, it demonstrated to handle really well the expectations ,1
www.bitfinex.com, top exchange as far as fund raised with the ieo ,1
www.bitfinex.com, the vision is really strong and compelling ,1
www.bitfinex.com, great team developed a solid platform ,1
www.bitfinex.com, really good working product ,1
www.celeschain.io,this is really great project that keeps one focusing on the successful future of this project you guy's are really wonderful,1
www.thetatoken.org,this is really good project with awesome team ,1
www.thetatoken.org, team have a solid background and working with good progress ,1
www.thetatoken.org, i would recommend this to investors will be competition to other projects like gladius ,1
www.kubitx.io,this is really an awesome project with loads of potential ,1
www.kubitx.io, i was fortunate enough to meet the team and some of the advisors at the global blockchain congress last year and they are clearly passionate about what they are doing ,1
www.kubitx.io, i have also collaborated with some of the advisors and team members on other projects as well so i know how dedicated they can be ,1
goldbox.io,this is really a great innovationsolve my problem of cash flow ,1
tokensale.kasko2go.com,this is really a good idea ,1
tokensale.kasko2go.com, i have seen something similar in the uk called block box insurance using iot devices to monitor young drivers to reduce their insurance costs by rewarding them for good driving behaviour ,1
tokensale.kasko2go.com, you will need good oracles for real time data integration into the blockchain which should be interesting challenge,0 
betbox.app,this is quite an interesting project ,1
betbox.app, the idea is very simple but was actully very well thought and planned ,1
betbox.app, the use of a sidechain in order to provide better scalability in case ethereum does not solve their own issues is a good overall approach ,1
betbox.app,but might raise a flag in the security aspect but as long as the transactions are not stored there but in ethereum's blockchain it should not present any issues ,1
betbox.app, the first thing that caught my attention was the fact that they are very straight forward and clear with the contrbutor which is a big plus in this space ,1
betbox.app, that being said the tge is a lottery in itself which means it's not really an investment again,0
betbox.app, they are clear since the begining ,1
betbox.app, i also liked the idea that this is one of the few projects that are not playing this shady ico game like the rest ,1
betbox.app, they are not paying exchange fees for listing nor crazy expensive marketing campaigns ,1
betbox.app, i think it's somewhat corageous nowadays ,1
betbox.app, the team is really experienced and the screenshots of the products look really great ,1
betbox.app, i think they can execute a project like this without major issues ,1
betbox.app, vision might be analyzed in two ways: 1 the project/idea is not really unique there are many betting platforms out there moving into a decentralized approach ,0
betbox.app, 2 but the way they are planning their project does require a lot of brains for making it unique in their own way ,1
elrond.com,this is quite an eye catching and interesting project ,1
elrond.com, they have a very good team with blockchain knowledge and experience spread across it ,1
elrond.com, they also have a good vision and a clear white paper i look forward to seeing this one develop,1
hawk.cool,this is quite a joke ,0
hawk.cool, weak management team and their linkedin bios tell you nothing whatsoever,0 
hawk.cool, their cmo has no marketing training ,0
hawk.cool, marketing/video is completely useless unprofessional and leaves you hanging about how iot ai and blockchain are used at all ,0
hawk.cool, you end up asking more questions after watching video ,0
hawk.cool, avoid this timewaster ,0
faireum.io,this is one of those projects that looks good all the way round it ,1
faireum.io, the idea is simple yet it has been planned in detail ,1
faireum.io, it is also a good application of blockchain technology as it attempts to solve the main issues in the gambling industry ,1
faireum.io, the websites the whitepaper and all the information they provide is consistent and reassuring that this project is a serious business ,1
faireum.io, the team is rock solid ,1
faireum.io, they have the experience in all the required areas for a project of this kind to have good chances of success ,1
faireum.io, if they can keep up with the roadmap in time and deliver what is in it it is a very promising ico ,1
faireum.io, tokenomics are not the best out there since only 50% will be offered for sale with that being said the numbers are stated clearly and contributors have the information they need to decide on whether they want to participate or not ,1
faireum.io, to sumarize it: interesting promising project with lots of effort and hard work from every team member to make it happen in an optimum way ,1
faireum.io, this is an honest and unpaid review ,1
faireum.io, i do not request nor accept payments in exchange for reviews nor projects should pay ransom to fix bad reviews ,1
faireum.io, if an expert demands payment report him and help clean ico bench from corruption ,1
www.academytoken.com,this is one of the very few game changer icos on the market ,1
www.academytoken.com, the shortage of developers is something that has to be solved for the entire blockchain space to thrive ,1
www.academytoken.com, pros: international accreditation from sacs ,1
www.academytoken.com, strong transparent team ,1
www.academytoken.com, world class advisors ,1
www.academytoken.com, literally best i've seen ,1
www.academytoken.com, established saas education platform and curriculum ,1
www.academytoken.com, monetization of the academy token ,1
www.academytoken.com, extensive / detailed whitepaper ,1
www.academytoken.com, generating revenues from clients on the platform ,1
www.academytoken.com,cons: limited social presence academy is teaching students now with the first graduates available for hire later this month march 2018 the accreditation from sacs casi and the scorm compliance for the online system will allow academy to grow revenue from corporate clients in addition to start ups ,0
howdoo.io,this is one of the really exciting icos of 2018 with an actual strong token usage case ,1
howdoo.io, the howdoo social platform is in good hands with a very strong team which gives lots of confidence in the project ,1
howdoo.io, i’m very much focused on the udoo token at the minute as it is indeed a sleeping giant ,1
howdoo.io, the platform will introduce millions of users to the udoo token naturally using the baked in howdoo multicurrency wallet ,1
howdoo.io, these users are in all likelihood not crypto enthusiast and this means udoo will be the first cryptocurrency these users ever own ,1
howdoo.io, this is just one of many reason why howdoo and the udoo token is worth keeping an eye on ,1
howdoo.io, it’s potential is eye watering ,1
ellcrys.org,this is one of the projects most have missed but i have invested ,1
ellcrys.org, i actually believed in the success of the project but it disappointed me ,0
ellcrys.org, i'm not very sure what is going on now as the team is not that much transparent ,0
ellcrys.org, but they are continuing the development as it seems ,1
ellcrys.org, i still haven't lost hope and i am sure that this project is a good alternative to github acquired by microsoft ,1
ellcrys.org, good luck guys!,1
volentix.io,this is one of the most complete visions it is very interesting that they already build the 3 supporting applications for the community to use in order to be able to create the decentralized exchange on top of a full infrastructure ,1
volentix.io, this is something unique and a great vision that will probably be a buzz ,1
volentix.io, i must say information is not easy to find the team must make a better website and provide more information,0
volentix.io, but after some research i see that this project has been around for a long time and they have a lot of things done already ,1
volentix.io, they are addressing what is needed to bring more users to cryptocurrencies and they have taken the important foundations from thinkers so they are decentralized for real ,1
volentix.io, the author of the dae article on the volentix website is dane keller rutledge he has very interesting articles on medium and volentix takes a lot from that thinking ,1
volentix.io, a project like this took a long time to build and the software that they already built is more than most projects usually have done at this stage ,1
volentix.io, some projects from 2017 still have no software and raised thousands of eth already while volentix has done all this before they raise any funds ,1
volentix.io, they seem to have raised 7 figures as one press release said in early seed funding and that is reassuring ,1
volentix.io, i think the team is building a good project and have a very ambitious vision but already proved that they are doing it ,1
volentix.io, i give this project a thumbs up ,1
www.medai.network,this is one of the better health + ai blockchain solutions that i've come across ,1
www.medai.network, the whitepaper goes into detail on the algorithms already available to identify a number of conditions and an expandable system architecture that will enable further applications ,1
www.medai.network, what's missing though is an explanation of the utility and crypto token economics ,0
www.medai.network, how are the service costs related to tokens issued? the cost for proof of storage is mentioned but i'm unclear about the cost to request a diagnosis and other services ,0
baanx.com,this is officially my third review of this ico my first review was fives across the board because i loved the concept ,1
baanx.com, after remembering how hard it is to start a bank in the us i lowered my score ,0
baanx.com, after realizing that getting the banking system to change is one of the hurdles the entire industry faces,0
baanx.com, i am back to fives across the board baanx is like the expedia com of exchanges combined with a very franchise friendly and scalable banking concept ,1
www.decibels.io,this is not well thought out enough yet ,0
www.decibels.io, my scores can go up but right now the team is tiny the project is far too design led visually when it's the architecture that needs to be proven and shown ,0
www.decibels.io, one guy from china as cto is just not going to cut it in terms of tech team ,0
www.decibels.io, whitepaper is stretched with large text and graphics there's not much there really,0
www.chainium.io,this is not up to date ,0
www.chainium.io, the ico is still going and the token metrics is wrong ,0
qiibee.com,this is not the first time we are hearing of such a project but the team looks experienced and has potential to excel especially with a running mvp and some partner projects on the way which can be what differentiates them from the rest ,1
qiibee.com, hoping to see more reputable partners in the coming months and more users on board,1
cprop.io,this is not the first time someone has tried to implement blockchain tech in the real estate industry and it certainly is a compelling case if they can pull it off successfully ,1
cprop.io, team looks good and mvp is functional ,1
cprop.io, i just hope they don't fizzle out like the other companies that tried to do it ,0
bx.bet,this is not the first project to come up with a decentralized betting exchange ,0
bx.bet, there is no real wow ,0
bx.bet, factor to the project for me versus other competition great that there is already an mvp and i hope they do something to differentiate themselves from the rest ,1
somesing.io,this is not the first project in music service and blockchain but in karaoke it is ,1
somesing.io, they have strong team ,1
somesing.io, be careful not to copy and paste tik tok for karaoke ,1
zaza-world.io,this is not the first company trying to make a b2b platform and network on blockchain ,0
zaza-world.io, in fact it's not even clear what exactly their product it ,0
zaza-world.io, would have been better if they had a mvp at least ,0
zaza-world.io, happy to test the mvp when it's out ,1
skychain.global,this is not a good start for an ico ,0
skychain.global, launching the ico should be the easy part the product is the hard part ,0
www.virtualrehab.co,this is not a bad project and to a large extent should be rooted for the idea of incentivisation makes sense and the use of high tech instruments including blockchain may give this project a lead in this industry ,1
www.virtualrehab.co, revised rating after looking into the team backgrounds ,1
bravocoin.io,this is not a breakthrough this is a joke ,0
bravocoin.io, no product inexperienced team cheap website and trying to collect money by flashing some videos ,0
bravocoin.io, beware people beware also from any ceoklub related activities,0
www.reflexiontoken.io,this is no doubt a rather unique offering ,1
www.reflexiontoken.io, i like the concept and i do believe there is a good market for this sort of service globally ,1
www.reflexiontoken.io, it's good to see they have already started operating with their first lounge ,1
www.reflexiontoken.io, i do think however that they should have added dates to their roadmap on their website ,0
provoco.me,this is my first ico participation! the reason i chose provoco to be my first ico participation among the so many is that i love provoco's concept and goals ,1
provoco.me, as well as not only to become a successful business but a positive influence to the people ,1
provoco.me, it will be nice to see provoco become very popular ,1
token.nyigde.com,this is my first ico,1
bytus.io,this is much needed and the size of the market for this type of service is likely to explode over the next 24 months ,1
bytus.io, great product great vision and lots of potential for growth ,1
tokenstars.com,this is mortal for investors ,0
tokenstars.com, whale more then 60% discount red flag ,0
tokenstars.com, i dont change my opinion my best hit is investors not other ,0
300tokensparta.com, the team is not published no whitepaper or other detailed information about the vision and no project or mvp or even an app or ui/ux mockup is available ,0
300tokensparta.com, which is not necessary for this type of project of course ,1
300tokensparta.com, but the team behind it would've been nice to see ,0
300tokensparta.com, i would likely want to own one of these just for the hell of it as i've enjoyed the corresponding movie ,1
300tokensparta.com, it seems more like a joke and should've not been accepted by the platform ,0
